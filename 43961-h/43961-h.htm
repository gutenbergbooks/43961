<p>The development of the American Life-Saving
Service covers nearly a century.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;... The initiatory movement was the organization
by a few benevolent persons of the Massachusetts
Humane Society in 1786. In attempting to
alleviate the miseries of shipwreck on the Massachusetts
coast, small huts were built; and in 1807 the
first life-boat station was established at Cohasset.
The Society depended upon voluntary crews, but so
much was accomplished of value that some pecuniary
aid was received, as time wore on, from both
State and general governments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The magnificent work of the Coast Survey,
begun in earnest in 1832, absorbed the resources of
Congress for a decade and a half, during which
period nothing was attempted in the way of life-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>saving
except through voluntary societies. A few
public vessels were, indeed, authorized in 1837 to
cruise near the coast for the assistance of shipping
in distress, but it was through the movement in aid
of commerce, which extended to the lighthouse
system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1847, five thousand dollars were appropriated
by Congress toward furnishing lighthouses on the
Atlantic with the facilities for aiding shipwrecked
mariners. The money, after remaining in the
Treasury two years unused, was permitted to be
expended by the Massachusetts society upon Cape
Cod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the summer of 1848, the Hon. William A.
Newell, then a member of the House of Representatives
from New Jersey, incited by some terrible
shipwrecks on the coast of that State, induced Congress,
through his eloquence, to appropriate ten
thousand dollars for providing surf-boats and other
appliances &lsquo;for the protection of life and property
from shipwreck on the coast between Sandy Hook
and Little Egg Harbor.&rsquo; During the next session a
still larger appropriation was obtained. Twenty-two
station-houses were erected on the coasts of
New Jersey and Long Island, and although no persons
were paid or authorized to take charge of them,
and they were manned by extemporized crews, their
value in several cases of shipwreck was so great that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Congress made further appropriations from year to
year, and stations and life-boats gradually multiplied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through the pressure of a shocking event in
1854&mdash;the loss of three hundred lives off the New
Jersey coast&mdash;a local superintendent was employed,
a keeper assigned to each station, and bonded custodians
placed in charge of the life-boats, which had
been repeatedly stolen; but the absence of drilled
and disciplined crews, of general regulations, and of
energetic central administration rendered the record
of the institution unsatisfactory, and its benefits
checkered by the saddest failures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the year 1871, Sumner I. Kimball succeeded
to the head of the Revenue Marine Bureau of the
Treasury Department, under the charge of which
were the life-saving stations. He made it his first
business to ascertain their condition. Captain John
Faunce was detailed to make a tour of inspection,
and was accompanied a portion of the way by Mr.
Kimball himself. The buildings were found neglected
and dilapidated, the apparatus rusty or
broken, portable articles had been carried off, the
salaried keepers were often living at a distance from
their posts, some of them too old for service, and
others incompetent, and the volunteer crews were in
a quarrelsome temper with each other and with the
coast population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
&ldquo;Then commenced that vigorous prosecution of
reform which has crowned the humane work with
unprecedented success. Making the most of slender
appropriations, and in the face of perpetual discouragements,
this one man, the chief of a bureau,
pushed on by philanthropic impulses and guided by
unerring judgment, brought a complete and orderly
system into effect. It was not the work of a day,
nor of a year. It required patience, sagacity, and
rare powers of organization and government. He
knew no office hours, working day and night at
what many were pleased to consider a hopeless task.
In his brain originated the idea of guarding the
entire coasts of the nation through the planting of a
chain of fortresses to be garrisoned by disciplined
conquerors of the sea. It is a matter of public
record, and generally known to the country, that
through his practical devotion to the cause this has
been so nearly accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In reorganizing what there was of the Service,
he prepared a code of regulations for its absolute
control. The duties of every man employed were
minutely defined. The lazy, the careless, and the
unworthy were dismissed, and men chosen to fill
their places with sole reference to integrity and professional
fitness. Politics was abolished. That is,
experts in the surf were regarded as of more consequence
to drowning victims than voters of any particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
political ticket. The station-houses were
repaired, and increased in numbers as fast as the
means afforded by Congress would allow; the appliances
for life-saving were restored, and improved
from year to year through the best inventions and
discoveries in this or any other country, and a
rigid system of inspection and of patrol was inaugurated....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The record of the first season on the New York
and New Jersey coasts, where the new system first
went into actual operation, showed that every person
imperiled by shipwreck was saved. Consequently
a commission, consisting of Mr. Kimball, Captain
Faunce, and Captain J.&nbsp;H. Merryman, of the Revenue
Marine, surveyed in 1873, by order of Congress,
the vast and varied coasts of the oceans and lakes,
investigating personally the characteristics of the
dangerous localities, and holding consultations with
underwriters, shipowners, captains of vessels, and
veteran surfmen. The report of this commission
placed before Congress a minute account of the
disasters to vessels on every mile of coast for the
previous ten years; a bill based upon it, prepared
by Mr. Kimball, became a law June 20, 1874. It
provided for the extension of the field of this great
national work of humanity; for the bestowal of
medals of honor upon persons risking their lives to
save others; and empowered the collection and tabulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of statistics of disaster to shipping, which,
by reference to the periodicity of marine casualties,
aided in determining the points most needing protection,
and in various other ways benefited both
government and maritime interests....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The life-saving stations on the Atlantic seaboard
are now within an average distance of five
miles of each other, each crew consisting of a keeper
and six surfmen. At sunset two men start from
each station, one going to the right and the other
to the left. They are equipped with lanterns and
Coston signals, and each pursues his solitary and
perilous way through the soft sand, in spite of flooding
tides, bewildering snowfalls, overwhelming
winds, and bitter cold....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The night is divided into four watches. The
keeper is required to register in his log-book the
name of each patrolman, his hours on patrol, ...
the direction and force of the wind at sunrise, noon,
sunset, and midnight, together with the events of
each day. This record is sent to the chief of the
Service at Washington at the end of every week....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stations consist of three classes, severally
denominated life-saving stations, life-boat stations,
and houses of refuge. Each of the twelve districts
is provided with a local superintendent, who must
be a resident of the district and familiarly acquainted
with its inhabitants....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
&ldquo;The stations are visited frequently, and the men
examined in the exercises of the apparatus drill,
and obliged to give verbal reasons for every step in
their operations. They are trained with their life-boats
in the surf, in the use of the life-dress, in
saving drowning persons by swimming to their relief,
in the methods of restoring the partially drowned,
and in signalling. When a wreck is attended with
loss of life, a rigid examination follows to see if any
of the men have been guilty of misconduct or neglect
of duty. The keepers are empowered to protect the
interests of the government from smuggling, and
they guard all property that comes ashore from a
wreck until its rightful owners appear. They are
charged with the care and order of the stations, and
the boats and apparatus; and they must keep accurate
accounts of all receipts and expenditures,
journalize all transactions, and maintain all necessary
correspondence with superior officers. Thus it appears
they must possess a certain amount of education
and high integrity, as well as surfmanship,
intrepidity, and commanding qualities....&rdquo;&mdash;<i class="cite">Harper&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, February, 1882.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the close of the year 1894 the total number of
stations in the Life-Saving Establishment was 247.
Of this number, 182 were situated on the Atlantic
and Gulf coasts, 51 on the coasts of the Great Lakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
13 on the Pacific Coast, and 1 at the Falls of the
Ohio, Louisville, Kentucky. Their distribution by
life-saving districts was as follows:</p>

<span class="subhead">A BOY AND A DOG.</span></h2>

<p>It was on the afternoon of December 23d, in the
year 1893, that one of the life-saving crews in the
First District was completely prepared for work,
although neither vessel nor wreck was to be seen.</p>

<p>The wind was from the northeast and the driving
sleet and snow shut out from view all that portion
of the rocky coast save in the immediate vicinity of
the station. During the afternoon the gale had
increased in force until it was what a mariner would
call &ldquo;stiff&rdquo;; the sea had risen with equal pace, and
every indication confirmed the prediction made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
among the surfmen, that an ugly winter storm was
at hand.</p>

<p>At such a time the gallant life-saving crews along
the coast are ever ready for, and expecting, the
signal which calls them to their perilous work; but
not ordinarily do they stand by their apparatus as
on this afternoon, for, fortunately, many a winter
tempest fails in its harvest of death.</p>

<p>At noon on this day information was sent to the
station that the patrol several miles down the coast
had sighted a large ship so nearly inshore that,
under the adverse condition of wind and sea, she
could not tack, and there was not sufficient room to
wear. Unless her course was speedily changed, so
ran the information received,&mdash;and in the teeth of
the fierce northeast tempest and the shoreward
heaving of the tremendous sea that seemed impossible,&mdash;it
was certain she must strike somewhere
nearabout this particular station.</p>

<p>From the moment such information was received
the patrol on the beach had been doubled, and,
knowing full well how difficult it would be, under all
the circumstances, for any craft to escape the perils
to which it was said this ship was exposed, the crew
were keenly on the alert for the first token of wreck.</p>

<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening no further news
of the vessel had been obtained; therefore the men
whose mission it is to save life understood that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
ship was still fighting against the gale, and knew full
well every moment gained by her increased the
chances of escape, even though it had seemed impossible
she could weather the point.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Surfman Samuel Hardy, breathless
and panting, literally burst his way into the
station, as he cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Cushing has just lighted his signal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All members of life-saving crews carry, while
patrolling the shore on the lookout for signs of
danger to others, what is known as a &ldquo;Coston signal,&rdquo;
an ingenious contrivance which can be lighted
by concussion, and, therefore, may be displayed
regardless of the weather.</p>

<p>No further information was necessary; the crew
knew full well that the ship previously reported as
being in peril, and which had made such a gallant
fight against the elements, had at last been conquered.</p>

<p>Before Sam Hardy could take his station at the
beach-wagon, in which is transported all the apparatus
necessary for the work of the crew when a
wreck is close inshore, Joseph Cushing arrived:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has struck just off the west spit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is the ship?&rdquo; Keeper Thomas Downey
asked; and before the question could be answered
he gave in rapid succession the orders necessary for
beginning the work of rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
&ldquo;Open boat-room doors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the beach-wagon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These commands were superfluous, for the crew,
after long experience at such work, both during
tempests when human life was to be saved, and at
drill in fair weather, moved as if by instinct.</p>

<p>The last word had no more than been spoken
before the heavy wagon rolled down the platform to
the sand, every man fully aware of the fact that now
had come the time when the span of many lives might
be measured by seconds if they faltered or delayed.</p>

<p>From the official report is taken the following account
of the disaster:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that the ship had been laboring
heavily, the wind constantly heading her off after
nightfall, and the master, although he kept up a stout
heart, must have been well aware that he was constantly
losing more and more of the narrow margin
that lay between possible safety and inevitable destruction.
Whatever misgivings the crew may have
experienced, the survivor states that the first intimation
they had of their immediate proximity to
the shore was when they saw the breakers, and the
captain, who was below at the moment, rushed on
deck with the ominous outcry, &lsquo;She has struck!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boats were still on the bridge where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
had been originally stowed for the voyage, their
covers and lashings intact and the tackles unhooked,
but Captain Clark instantly gave the order to clear
them away, and, together with the men, set about
the work. The ship lay with her starboard side to
the waves, which the next instant lifted her farther
shoreward and then fell crashing on board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most of the sailors fled to the mizzen
shrouds, but a few, more daring or desperate than
the rest, still struggled to clear the boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another run of towering breakers was now about
to leap on board, and the brave men were compelled
to give over and quickly join their shipmates in the
rigging. At this moment the red glare of the patrolman&rsquo;s
signal gleamed through the darkness, and a
cheer broke forth from the shipwrecked men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to this time the master had found no difficulty
in controlling the movements of the crew, who
appear to have been able and obedient sailors; but
now there was no longer any occasion for the exercise
of authority, and in the dreadful situation it
behooved every man to look out for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Within ten minutes from the flash of the signal
the great iron hull parted amidships, and the mainmast
toppled over, carrying with it the mizzen-topmast.
The entire ship&rsquo;s company, except the
captain, were at this time in the mizzen-rigging,
where they were able to hold on only a few minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
when all were washed overboard together. The
captain, when last seen was standing on the ladder
at the quarter-deck, supporting himself with a hand
on each rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beach-apparatus was on the ground and
ready for service; but the ship was only now and
then faintly visible, and there was little reason to
believe the crew&rsquo;s efforts would be of any avail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, the gun was aimed as well as possible
in the direction of the wreck, which was discernible
only as a black shadow that seemed a little darker
than the surrounding gloom, and the shot was fired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the line fell across the hulk there is no
reason to doubt. That it lodged with considerable
firmness somewhere was conclusive to the keeper in
charge, for it resisted the slight strain put upon it
to determine whether it was fast, but no pull or
manipulation on the offshore end could be detected,
and after waiting in vain some considerable time for
that always welcome sign that the line has been
found by the shipwrecked, the life-savers hauled hard
on it until it finally parted under the heavy strain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The keeper was now satisfied that there was no
living being on board the wreck. Nothing could
be accomplished by additional efforts to effect communication
by means of the gun, and the fury of
the surf was so overwhelming that none of the men,
familiar as they were with the conditions, of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
experience on the coast, and brave as they had often
proved themselves, even so much as entertained the
thought of launching the boat. It was out of
question, absolutely and beyond all possibility of
cavil. The slatting of the distant sails is described as
sounding like peals of thunder, and the crashing of
blocks and chains as they were flung back and forth
against the wire rigging and iron foremast, sent out
volumes of blazing sparks that seemed like signals
of distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the custom on occasions of this kind to
build a fire on the shore as a beacon of hope to encourage
the shipwrecked, and although there was
believed to be nobody on the vessel, this would
nevertheless have been done, if possible. But the
gale blew with such force that a fire could not be
maintained, and, indeed, so terrific was its fury that
the polished glass lantern on the beach-apparatus
cart was converted into a good specimen of ground
glass by the incessant beating of the driven sand
upon its surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now and then a red signal was discharged to
attract the attention of any poor fellow who might
be washed ashore alive, and a faithful search-patrol
was maintained along the beach by the entire crew.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>That portion of the shore upon which the wind
and the current would most likely cast up fragments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of the wreck was thickly dotted with every available
lantern from the station in the hope that these tiny
rays of light might serve as beacons for some sailor
whose life had not been crushed out of him by the
fury of the surf, and with eager eyes the men peered
into the foaming swirl of waters.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, and no sign either of life or
death came from the wreck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is little chance the breath will yet remain
in any who comes ashore now,&rdquo; Keeper Downey
said to Joe Cushing, and the latter replied only with
a mournful shake of the head, for it did not seem
possible any living thing could come through that
mighty surge.</p>

<p>The words had no more than been spoken, however,
when far away in the distance could be heard
the cry of Sam Hardy, and without being able to
distinguish the words, those who heard knew from
the tone that he had sighted life in some form.</p>

<p>All the crew ran that way in hot haste, the keeper
leading, and arriving at the spot just as Hardy, all
regardless of his own life, had plunged waist-deep
into the surf that he might seize upon a short spar
to which was lashed a dark mass.</p>

<p>None save those who had been trained to the duty
of saving life under such circumstances would have
recognized the possibility that a human being might
be concealed beneath what appeared to be only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
valueless wreckage; but the crew knew by long experience
that amid this particular flotsam would be
found, either alive or dead, some one from the ill-fated
ship.</p>

<p>As Hardy had dashed into the surf so did the
others, until a living chain had been formed, and by
this means the spar was pulled on shore despite the
heavy undertow which strove with giant force against
the efforts of the life-savers.</p>

<p>Once the wreckage was beyond reach of the towering,
roaring waves, few seconds were spent in learning
whether the men had, by risking their own lives,
saved a human being from death, or if it was but
a corpse which had been wrested from the angry
waters.</p>

<p>From amid wrappings of what appeared to be the
fragment of a sail was seen the head of a child; the
face was pallid as if death had already set its seal
upon it, and not so much as a tremor of the lips
could be distinguished in the faint light cast by the
lanterns.</p>

<p>The cold was searching; the garments of the crew
were already stiffening with ice, and if life was to be
prevented from leaving that small body, all efforts
must be made within the shelter of the station.</p>

<p>Acting upon the keeper&rsquo;s orders, the little form
was released from the bonds of rope which held it
fast to the spar, and with all speed carried to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
building where could be found everything needful
for the coming struggle against death.</p>

<p>It was a small boy, apparently ten or twelve years
of age, who had been rescued, and as the kindly
men with tender care removed the icy clothing, they
were startled, almost alarmed for the moment, by
seeing a very small dog, his long white hair soaked
with water, leap from beneath the lad&rsquo;s tightly
buttoned pea-jacket.</p>

<p>The animal shook itself, looked quickly around
with a low whine, and, recognizing the boy, began
eagerly licking his face, as if understanding that immediate
aid of some kind was necessary.</p>

<p>The members of the crew had lost no time in
taking such measures as were needful, and although
the small dog growled furiously when they rolled
the boy face downward, having previously laid him
upon the floor of the station, the efforts at resuscitation
were both skilful and vigorous.</p>

<p>Before the work had fairly begun the lad showed
signs of life by opening his eyes, and his first glance
fell upon the dog, which was standing near by, wagging
its tail furiously as if to attract attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s coming around all right,&rdquo; Keeper
Downey said in a tone of satisfaction, and then,
noting the troubled look which suddenly came over
the little fellow&rsquo;s face, he asked quickly, &ldquo;What is
it, my son? What are you wanting?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Clark here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t come ashore yet; but you&rsquo;re not to
trouble your head about anything except getting the
best of the salt water you&rsquo;ve taken aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be careful of Fluff until she gets
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning this little bundle of hair?&rdquo; the keeper
asked with a laugh, laying his hand on the dog&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; she thinks very much of him, an&rsquo; I
promised to keep him close in my arms if it so happened
that we had to come ashore lashed to the
spar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon you couldn&rsquo;t have done different, tied
together as you two were,&rdquo; Surfman Dick Sawyer
said with a laugh, and the keeper added kindly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to fret about the dog; he shall
have the run of the station, and there&rsquo;s nothing to
harm him while old Maje is in the boat-house&mdash;Maje
is our dog,&rdquo; Downey added as he read the question
in the boy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s large enough to swallow
two or three like this little one here; but I&rsquo;ll answer
for it your Fluff isn&rsquo;t in any danger, and to
set your mind at rest he shall stay close by you till
morning. We&rsquo;ll put you to bed now, I reckon;
there&rsquo;s other work for us outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can take care of myself, sir,&rdquo; the lad said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
bravely, as he attempted to struggle to his feet, the
dog meanwhile barking furiously as if cautioning his
young master against being too venturesome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Keeper Downey
said, catching the boy in time to prevent a fall,
and without further parley he carried him to the
sleeping-room above.</p>

<p>When the rescued lad was tucked snugly between
a generous supply of blankets, the dog curled himself
up on the outside of the bed with his nose close
beside the boy&rsquo;s cheek, and Keeper Downey muttered
to himself as he descended the stairs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all the ship&rsquo;s crew had been put away as
safe and comfortable as those two, we should have
done a night&rsquo;s work of which we might well be
proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then out into the howling, wintry blast went the
men who had brought the lad and the dog to the
station, and during the remainder of that terrible
night every man did patrol duty, pacing to and fro
along the rocky shore, or keeping faithful watch
over the narrow strip of beach, in the faint hope
that there might be other survivors, although there
was little chance that such could be the case.</p>

<p>To continue the official report: &ldquo;Only remnants
of spars and cargo, however, were cast at their feet,
and when daylight finally dawned all eyes were intently
turned toward the wreck with a vague hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
that, by some altogether improbable possibility,
there might be some signs of living men on board.
But there were none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The forward and after parts of the dismembered
hull were seen to be from thirty to forty yards apart,
lying at nearly a right angle with each other, the
former head on, and the latter, on which no masts
appeared, thrown on its beam ends, inclined toward
the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The foremast and foretopmast, bowsprit and jib-boom,
with most of the fore-rigging, were still in
place, and the lower yard was crossed amid a confusion
of tattered sails and tangled ropes. The waves
ran high up the mast, breaking almost into the foretop,
and shreds and fragments of the cargo of jute
wrapped themselves like ragged garments around
the shrouds and stays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dead body was discovered entangled in the
rigging on the after part of the wreck; but the keeper
did not deem it necessary to make an attempt to go
out with a boat while the surf was still extremely
dangerous, therefore this mournful duty was postponed
until the following day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing to be learned by remaining
where they were exposed to the full fury of the
gale, which had not abated, and the weary crew,
saddened because they had not been permitted to
save more lives, returned to the station, each man&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
garments so thickly encrusted with ice that only
limited movement was possible.</p>

<p>A large ship had foundered hardly more than half
a pistol-shot distant from the building, and of all on
board only a small boy and a tiny dog had been
rescued from the merciless waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait till the lad wakens, and then most
likely he can give us a smattering of the details,
although I don&rsquo;t allow he knows very much regarding
the disaster, for he must have been lashed to that
spar either just before, or immediately after, the
ship struck,&rdquo; Keeper Downey said as he sought to
refresh himself with the contents of a steaming bowl
of coffee.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">BENNY&rsquo;S STORY.</span></h2>

<p>When, at a late hour next morning, the boy and
the dog came down-stairs, the former appearing bewildered,
and the latter hanging his tail as if doubtful
of the reception he might meet with, only
Keeper Downey and Surfman Sam Hardy were to
be seen.</p>

<p>The other members of the crew were engaged outside
in the effort to save such wreckage as the yet
angry waters rolled in toward the shore.</p>

<p>A bright-looking little fellow was this survivor of
the terrible disaster, although not seen at his best
while clad only in his undergarments, and shivering
in the frosty air despite the volumes of heat sent
out by the glowing stove. The mercury in the
thermometer had fallen below the zero mark, and
the wind found every crevice and crack in the building,
situated as it was on the open shore where
nothing in the way of a shelter broke the force of
the northeast gales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, lad, you&rsquo;re looking bright this morning,&rdquo;
the keeper cried in a cheery tone. &ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can take my share of breakfast when it&rsquo;s
ready, and I guess Fluff won&rsquo;t turn up his nose at
warm coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dog drinking coffee!&rdquo; Sam Hardy cried, with
a laugh that had in it a note of the tempest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; Mrs. Clark always gave him a little out
of her own cup. Has she come ashore yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, lad,&rdquo; the keeper replied gravely. &ldquo;None
save you and the dog lived through last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be dead!&rdquo; the boy cried in alarm,
and as the full meaning of the words dawned upon
him, the tears came. &ldquo;Surely some of the men
would have looked out for Mrs. Clark! She was
coming ashore the same way I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had they lashed her to a spar before you were
set adrift?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain had everything ready: but I was
tied on first, &rsquo;cause she wanted to be certain Fluff
would be tucked inside my coat properly. Surely
she&rsquo;ll come soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may as well know the truth at once, lad;
I&rsquo;m not a man who believes in keeping back bad
tidings, because they must be told at some time.
Even if Mrs. Clark was set adrift on a spar, she
couldn&rsquo;t have lived through the night. You are
the only survivor of the wreck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The waves have knocked her to pieces long before
this, and our crew are out looking after the
wreckage as it comes ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While one might have counted ten the lad stood
looking at the keeper searchingly, and then, gathering
the dog in his arms, he gave vent to the grief
that had so suddenly come into his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave him alone for a spell, Sam,&rdquo; the
keeper whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do him good to have a
good cry, and seeing&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve got little chance of
sending in a report till after the storm clears up,
there&rsquo;s no sense in bothering him with questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the two kind-hearted men tiptoed softly
out of the station, lest the sound of their footsteps
might add to the grief in the boy&rsquo;s heart, and the
dog, pricking up his ears as if understanding every
word spoken, apparently listened to the first outpouring
of sorrow and utter desolation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be possible, Fluffy, that every one has
been drowned! It couldn&rsquo;t be, God would take
Captain Clark and his wife, with all the crew, leaving
only you an&rsquo; me here! Why, Fluff! If the
man told us the truth, what&rsquo;ll become of us?
We&rsquo;re alone in the world, do you understand that?
Nobody who&rsquo;ll help us anywhere! What&rsquo;ll become
of you, my poor little man, and she loved you
so dearly!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if in reply the dog licked the boy&rsquo;s face, and
this evidence of affection appeared but to render
more heavy the grief, for, throwing himself upon
the floor, holding his dumb companion yet more
closely, the poor lad gave way to the sorrow which
had come with such cruel suddenness upon him.</p>

<p>He was yet in this position when the keeper and
two of the crew entered the building an hour
later.</p>

<p>In the boat-house, covered with flags, were the
bodies of the captain and his wife, and near by lay
three of the crew, all in the awful silence and stillness
of death.</p>

<p>Keeper Downey laid his hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder
to attract his attention, and the dog, mistaking
this friendly touch for an attack, sprang up, barking
furiously, until it seemed as if the volume of sound
must shatter the tiny body.</p>

<p>Sam Hardy took it upon himself to make friends
with the little animal, and since the keeper no
longer attempted to touch the sorrowing lad, Fluff
ceased his shrill yelps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, lad,&rdquo; the keeper said, throwing a
coat over the half-clad form. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruel sorrow
that has come upon you; but remember that there
are others in this world who have been as cruelly
afflicted,&mdash;that you are not alone in your grief.
Somewhere are wives and children waiting for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
return of the poor fellows who went down with the
ship, and you must not be selfish in your sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy looked up with swollen eyes, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, you are selfish to give way to all
that&rsquo;s in your heart when it is possible you can be
of service to others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sad as the news will be to many, it is necessary
they should learn of what happened last night, and
you are the only one who can tell the story. I must
make a report on the wreck, and am looking to you
for the information. There is yet something to be
done&mdash;the last in this world&mdash;by friends and relatives
for such of the bodies as come ashore, and if you
give way to selfish sorrow, the word cannot be sent
out from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad was on his feet in an instant, and, choking
back the sobs as best he might, while the dog
nestled contentedly in his arms, he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you want, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, the name of the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>, from Calcutta to Boston,
David Clark, master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know how much of a crew she carried?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five, all told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any other women except the captain&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benjamin H. Foster; but Mrs. Clark always
called me &lsquo;Benny,&rsquo;&rdquo; the lad replied, and at mention
of the woman&rsquo;s name his grief overwhelmed him
once more.</p>

<p>The eyes of the keeper and his comrades were not
free from a certain moisture, and more than one
furtively passed the sleeve of his rough coat across
his face as all waited for the lad to recover his composure
in a measure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to cry again, sir,&rdquo; Benny said piteously,
after struggling a moment to force back the
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well you should grieve, lad; don&rsquo;t think I
blamed you for doing what is only natural. When
it is possible you shall tell all you know about the
ship and her voyage, giving the names of those
members of the crew that come to mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two hours or more passed before Benny had
concluded the sad story, and then Keeper Downey
was in possession of such facts as were necessary for
the proper making up of his official report.</p>

<p>According to Benny&rsquo;s tale the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> had
sailed from Calcutta, India, on the 15th of February,
and, because of previous disasters, the voyage
had consumed almost ten months, during which
time the ship had covered a distance equal to one
half the circuit of the globe.</p>

<p>She was loaded with ten thousand bales of jute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
while crossing the Indian Ocean she had run into a
cyclone and been dismasted. Under jury-rig the
ship was worked to Port Louis, Mauritius, where,
after being unloaded, she was thoroughly overhauled
and repaired. Not until the middle of September
was the voyage resumed, and nothing of note occurred
until the vicinity of the Bermudas was
reached, when frequent squalls set in, following the
vessel until she made the coast of the United States.</p>

<p>Captain Clark had not been able to take an observation
for several days, and, therefore, was forced
to rely upon what mariners term &ldquo;dead reckoning.&rdquo;
Two days prior to the wreck he spoke a New York
pilot-boat, from which he learned his whereabouts,
but after passing George&rsquo;s Shoal, about one hundred
miles to the eastward of Cape Cod, he determined
to shape his course straight to the westward until
sighting the land.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the lack of observations to determine
his situation, the captain might easily have
discovered his danger by sounding, but instead of
doing so he held his course steadily without recourse
to the lead, until the dark, gloomy outline of the
land loomed up, ominous and forbidding.</p>

<p>It was evident from Benny&rsquo;s story that Captain
Clark realized at once the impossibility of working
the ship off from that lee shore, because to the best
of the lad&rsquo;s belief it must have been half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
before the ill-fated craft struck the rocks when he
was lashed to the spar, while at the same time preparations
were being made to care for the captain&rsquo;s
wife in similar fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only in case anything should happen that
this is being done,&rdquo; Mrs. Clark said to the boy,
with the evident purpose of strengthening his courage.
&ldquo;It may be that all will go well with us, and
then you and your Fluff will only have had a little
disagreeable experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twice before the final crash came did one of the
crew speak words of cheer to the lad, who was unable
to see what might be going on around him, and
from the nature of such remarks he believed all
hands felt certain the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> must strike the
coast.</p>

<p>That, in substance, was all the information Benny
could give regarding such matters as must be embodied
in the keeper&rsquo;s report; but the men, curious
to know how he chanced to be aboard the ship,
plied him with questions, and when they had been
answered the story of Benny Foster&rsquo;s life was told.</p>

<p>When quite young, he and his mother had sailed
in the ship <i class="ship">West Wind</i>, of which his father was the
captain, on what the lad believed was to be a long
voyage; but he failed to remember the port to
which the ship was bound. However, so far as concerned
him, that was of no particular importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
At some time&mdash;Benny thought he might have
been six years of age just then&mdash;his father was taken
ill in the port of Calcutta, and it was necessary to
provide a new master for the ship.</p>

<p>Captain Foster and his family took lodgings
ashore, and within a year Benny was both motherless
and fatherless. From that time on he had been
cared for in haphazard fashion by such acquaintances
as his parents had formed, and he believed some
efforts were made toward learning if he had any
relatives in the United States.</p>

<p>Whether anything was accomplished in that direction
he could not say; but simply knew that in January
of this same year Captain Clark sought him out
for the purpose of carrying him to Boston, having
learned of his condition from an American merchant
in Calcutta.</p>

<p>On board the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> he performed any light
tasks which would have come within a cabin-boy&rsquo;s
line of duty; but was treated by Mrs. Clark as a
friend rather than a servant, and so intimate an acquaintance
had sprung up between himself and Fluff
that he came to consider it his especial duty to care
for the little Angora terrier, whose bright pink eyes
gleaming out from amid the fluff of silken white hair
gave him the appearance of being a remarkably intelligent
animal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s just as bright as he looks,&rdquo; Benny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
said, as he concluded the poor story of his own life,
while he hugged the dog yet closer to his bosom.
&ldquo;Fluff knows almost everything I say to him, and
what he don&rsquo;t just understand he guesses at. Why,
before we had been out a week, Mrs. Clark let him
sleep with me in my berth, and when it was heavy
weather this poor little fellow would almost the same
as talk to me, scolding because the jumping of the
ship made him feel badly. His name was Fluff
Clark, of course; but now that he hasn&rsquo;t got anybody
in all this wide world but me, I&rsquo;m going to
adopt him, and he&rsquo;ll be Fluff C. Foster after this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It strikes me there&rsquo;s need of some one adopting
you, lad,&rdquo; Keeper Downey said with a grave smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain but that Fluff is better able to
care for himself than you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too good a dog to need much caring for.
Why, all he&rsquo;d eat in a day wouldn&rsquo;t amount to a
cent&rsquo;s worth, though he&rsquo;s mighty particular about
having things fixed up just such a way, and his pink
nose will wrinkle quick when there&rsquo;s nothing but
salt beef left over for him. We always had lump
sugar to give him for a treat; but he&rsquo;d get along
without that if he knew I couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy it
for him. It would surprise you to see how much
that dog knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Benny, eager that his pet should be duly
appreciated, exhibited the dog in his various tricks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and the members of the crew, seeing that by such
means the lad&rsquo;s thoughts were kept from his great
loss, applauded the performance until Fluff had
shown himself half a dozen times over in his various
acrobatic feats.</p>

<p>Keeper Downey rewarded the dumb performer,
who certainly sustained the reputation which his
young master had given him, and it was almost as
if those cold, silent forms in the boat-room had
been forgotten.</p>

<p>Benny&rsquo;s clothing was thoroughly dried, and while
Fluff entertained the crew, the lad fully dressed himself,
donning an old pea-jacket many sizes too large,
which had been wrapped about him when he was
lashed to the spar.</p>

<p>Keeper Downey set about making his report to
the Department, based on information supplied by
the only survivor of the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>, and the men resumed
their duties of watching for wreckage from
the ill-fated ship, leaving the homeless boy and his
only friend comparatively alone.</p>

<p>During the remainder of this day every man took
good care that Benny should not find his way into
the boat-room, and all seemed to believe it their
duty to prevent the lad&rsquo;s thoughts from straying
back into the past.</p>

<p>A toy full-rigged ship, which one of the crew had
fashioned during his hours of leisure, was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
down from its shelf that Benny might make a critical
examination of it, and each in turn had some
odd souvenir or curious memento of the sea to attract
the lad&rsquo;s attention, until, from the appearance of
the mess-table, one would have said a party of
children were being entertained.</p>

<p>Despite all their efforts, however, Benny&rsquo;s mind
would go back to the terrible evening just spent,
and many times while the kindly hearted men were
doing their best to cause forgetfulness, the big tears
overflowed his eyelids, although the boy did his best
to repress them.</p>

<p>When evening came, and supper had been served,
both Benny and Fluff were ready to retire, and after
the lad was tucked snugly in Sam Hardy&rsquo;s bed with
the dog&rsquo;s pink nose resting over his arm, such of the
crew as were not on duty came together to discuss
the future of these waifs who had been thrown up
by the sea into their keeping.</p>

<p>There was no formality attending this conference.
From Keeper Downey to Surfman Sawyer, all appeared
to believe that the lad and the dog were
under the especial protection of the crew attached
to this station, and not one made any effort to shift
the responsibility to another&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It stands to reason that the captain of the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>
did not know anything about the lad&rsquo;s people,
otherwise he or his wife must have said something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that Benny would have overheard,&rdquo; Keeper Downey
began, by way of opening what all tacitly understood
was a meeting of the &ldquo;board of guardians.&rdquo; &ldquo;It
may be that when the story of the wreck is told in
the newspapers, as will be done by to-morrow, some
one comes forward to claim the lad, though I doubt
it. Now there is nothing in the Service as provides
for such as he, except so far as giving food and
shelter to the shipwrecked until they can be removed
to other quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I allow it wouldn&rsquo;t be according to regulations
for us to keep him here?&rdquo; Joe Cushing said
interrogatively, and Keeper Downey replied emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless we have permission from headquarters.
But whether that can be gained or not goes
beyond me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we don&rsquo;t keep him? Allow that we
send him away?&rdquo; Henry Robbins asked. &ldquo;Where
could a boy like him be put?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other place but the poorhouse, if it
so be he hasn&rsquo;t any relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go there, if I have to pay for his
keeping out of my own pocket,&rdquo; Sam Hardy said
decidedly, whereat the other members of the crew
applauded, taking care to make but little noise lest
the sleeper in the chamber above should be awakened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Then Keeper Downey continued, much as if some
motion had been put, seconded, and carried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since we are all agreed that Benny and Fluff
are on our hands until a better home can be found
for &rsquo;em, the question comes as to how we&rsquo;ll divide
the expense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the cost be put equally among the crew,&rdquo;
Joe Cushing suggested. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t take such a
terrible amount of money to keep this little shaver
and his toy dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let every man contribute according to
his wages,&rdquo; Keeper Downey said, in the tone of one
who has finally settled the question. &ldquo;That will
be the fairest way, and, as Joe says, we never shall
miss it in the long run. It&rsquo;s where we can keep
him that is going to be the hardest thing to settle
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we pay his bills and he don&rsquo;t cost the Government
a cent, what&rsquo;s to prevent having him with us
all the time?&rdquo; Dick Sawyer asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll guarantee
that if we fix up a letter to the General Superintendent
of the Life-Saving Service, giving the
particulars, and explaining that the boy can help us
a good bit in the way of washing dishes, trimming
lanterns, and that sort of work, there won&rsquo;t be a
question raised as to his sharing a bed with one of
us. I&rsquo;ll take him in with me, when it comes to
that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would it be right to keep the lad out here?&rdquo;&mdash;and
it was as if Tom Downey asked the question of
himself. &ldquo;According to his own story, he hasn&rsquo;t
had over much schooling, and nowadays a boy who
ain&rsquo;t considerable of a scholar cuts a pretty poor
figure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any harm if that sort of business is
held off for another year,&rdquo;&mdash;and Joe Cushing leaned
forward eagerly as if fearing lest his companions
might disagree with him. &ldquo;I think on these long
winter days it will be mighty pleasant to have a
little shaver like him toddling round here with his
dog, and now the spring is so near at hand he
wouldn&rsquo;t get much of a whack at schoolin&rsquo; before
vacation-time comes. Besides, it would be cruel to
send him off just now, for he&rsquo;s beginning to get
acquainted with us, and if you put him among
strangers suddenly all of last night&rsquo;s business would
come back to him harder than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It could readily be seen that every member of the
crew was as eager to keep Benny and Fluff with
them, for a time at least, as was Joe Cushing, but
Tom Downey insisted that they had no right to thus
deprive the boy of the opportunity to attend school,
and a long discussion followed, the result of which
was extremely satisfying to Joe Cushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s agreed that we keep the lad here until next
fall, if it so be permission is given by the Department,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Keeper Downey said at length, summing up
the result of the arguments, &ldquo;and if the rules of
the Service won&rsquo;t allow his staying, we&rsquo;ll look around
for a boarding-place as near to the station as may be;
but I reckon there ain&rsquo;t much need of figgerin&rsquo; on
that, because the United States Government can&rsquo;t
make any kick about giving shelter to a little shaver
like Benny, especially when it don&rsquo;t cost a cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you start the letter now?&rdquo; Joe Cushing
suggested. &ldquo;If it goes in with your report I
allow it&rsquo;ll have greater weight, seein&rsquo; that the whole
story will be fresh in the minds of the officials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remainder of the crew believed Joe&rsquo;s suggestion
was timely, and Keeper Downey did not need
much urging to set him about the task immediately.</p>

<p>After referring the Superintendent to the official
report of the wreck, Downey gave briefly the story
Benny had told concerning himself, making the
request that the boy be allowed to remain at the
station during such time as the crew were willing to
provide for his wants, and concluding with the following
statement:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take a cent out of the government, for
we, as a crew, have agreed to pay his bills till he can
manage affairs for himself, and the little he costs
will be more than balanced by what labor he can
perform. He appears to be a willing lad, and
there&rsquo;s many an odd job he can do when we have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
long spell of hard work. It will be a good trade for
us, whichever way you look at the matter, and
surely the people of this big country won&rsquo;t begrudge
the giving of a shelter to a boy who has been in
such hard luck, especially when there&rsquo;ll be absolutely
no outlay on his account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that don&rsquo;t fix things, then the Life-Saving
Service is run under different rules and regulations
than I&rsquo;ve always reckoned on,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said
in a tone of satisfaction. &ldquo;I allow we can count
on having Benny and Fluff with us so long as we
pay their bills, and I&rsquo;m going to make first-class
surf men out of them both, or know the reason why.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">ON PATROL.</span></h2>

<p>When Benny and Fluff came down-stairs next
morning after the meeting of the &ldquo;board of guardians,&rdquo;
all the crew were in the mess-room, and
Keeper Downey greeted the lad right cheerily as he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It stands to reason, Benny, that you have been
troubled more or less about what&rsquo;s to become of
you, seein&rsquo; &rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve got no relatives that you know
about, an&rsquo; no friends, except it may be them as are
before you, this side of India. You must have
something to eat, and enough clothin&rsquo; to keep the
frost out, to say nothing of providin&rsquo; a home for
the dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny looked about him piteously. This broaching
the subject which had been present in his mind
almost constantly since he realized his desolate condition,
seemed much like the preface of some disagreeable
communication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got to send us away right off, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Downey?&rdquo; he asked, pressing Fluff&rsquo;s pink nose
against his cheek as if the contact gave him courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon that&rsquo;s got to be done, lad; but
you must understand that something ought to be
settled within a reasonably short time, and chiefly
for your own good. It&rsquo;s not benefiting a boy to
allow him to remain idle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m willing to work, Mr. Downey, and I
was thinking when we came down-stairs that I&rsquo;d ask
you if there wasn&rsquo;t some town near by where I
might find a job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I allow the town&rsquo;s there, Benny, but whether
a lad of your size and build could get a job big
enough to pay for the little he and the dog
would eat is another question. If it so be you was
minded to stay in the country, say out on the sea-shore,
I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a piece of work
could be scared up that would fix things smooth, so
far as it comes to board and lodging. I ain&rsquo;t
allowin&rsquo; there&rsquo;d be very much more than that in it,
&rsquo;cause you see, Benny, my lad, it don&rsquo;t stand to
reason you&rsquo;re worth any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything, Mr. Downey, anything that
would pay for our living, and I&rsquo;m sure Fluff
wouldn&rsquo;t mind it so very much if he didn&rsquo;t get
sugar when he knew I couldn&rsquo;t earn any money to
buy it with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my son, this &rsquo;ere job I&rsquo;ve got in my eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
would likely pay enough so that you could afford to
keep Fluff C. Foster in sugar. Leastways, I reckon
it wouldn&rsquo;t take much bargaining to bring it around
that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall I go to work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t well to lose any time, so me and my
mates have agreed that you&rsquo;d better start right in
this morning as soon as you&rsquo;ve had breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny looked around upon the weather-beaten,
kindly faces, and a big lump came up in his throat
which caused him no slight effort in the swallowing
of it. He had known these men hardly more than
twenty-four hours, and yet in that time they had
shown themselves as well disposed as if they had
been his best friends, and the thought of leaving
them to go among strangers brought the boy genuine
sorrow.</p>

<p>He buried his face in Fluff&rsquo;s silken hair for an instant,
and then, looking up, said with a brave effort
to prevent his lip from quivering, although he could
not choke back the tremor in his voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ready to go now, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to the looks of things you ain&rsquo;t
mightily pleased at the prospect of leaving,&rdquo;&mdash;and
Thomas Downey glanced meaningly at his comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all been very good to me, sir, and if
you&rsquo;d ever known how lonesome it is to be alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
same&rsquo;s Fluff and I are now, you couldn&rsquo;t wonder
that we was a little mite sorry to go away from such
a nice place; but I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Benny buried his face in Fluff&rsquo;s coat that
he might have time to choke back the rebellious
sobs, and Sam Hardy whispered in a voice that was
not remarkable for its steadiness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad to keep the little duffer in suspense,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s showing what he&rsquo;s made of now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s got grit,&rdquo; Joe Cushing added.</p>

<p>By this time Benny had conquered his emotions
once more, and looking up said with a feeble attempt
at a smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all been awful good to Fluff and me,
and we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget it. Unless we&rsquo;re going too
far away, both of us would like to come back once
in a while to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want to leave before breakfast?&rdquo;
Tom Downey suggested, and Benny, manfully
struggling with this new grief, replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t hungry; but if you&rsquo;ll give Fluff a little
something,&mdash;&rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s a dog an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t really know
all that&rsquo;s happening&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon we needn&rsquo;t keep this up any longer,
lad. You&rsquo;ve got a job, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re hoping there
won&rsquo;t be any call to leave this &rsquo;ere station; but if it
can&rsquo;t be fixed as we&rsquo;ve reckoned on, you shall live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
close by. There&rsquo;s nothing in the rules to prevent
your comin&rsquo; here every day, for regulation number
one, nought, seven, regarding the conduct of keepers,
says that they must be &lsquo;courteous and polite to
visitors,&rsquo; but it don&rsquo;t state how often a visitor may
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members of the crew expressed their satisfaction
in various ways at the keeper&rsquo;s astuteness in
thus discovering a means of at least partially carrying
out their desires, in case the head of the Department
disapproved of their taking on an assistant; but
Benny looked about him in perplexity. He failed
utterly to understand the proposition which Tom
Downey believed had been made exceedingly plain,
and Sam Hardy took it upon himself to explain
what they, as a crew, proposed doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like this, Benny,&rdquo; he began in a paternal
tone: &ldquo;It kind of seems as if you and Mr. Fluff
C. Foster was thrown on your beam ends, so to
speak, with the wind and tide both against you.
Now the government hires us to assist crafts in distress,
and, of course, you comin&rsquo; under that head,
we&rsquo;re bound to do all we can, else there&rsquo;d be danger
of losin&rsquo; our job. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A look of perplexity still remained upon the lad&rsquo;s
face, and Joe Cushing proceeded to perform his part
in making plain the situation of affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this, Benny: Tom and Sam mean all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
they say, but don&rsquo;t just give it to you in a way that
can be understood. Now a good, willing boy what
will tend out right sharp on such odd jobs as are
layin&rsquo; round the station, can earn his way here; an&rsquo;
when the Superintendent of the Life-Saving Service
hears how we, as a crew, have put this thing, it don&rsquo;t
stand to reason he&rsquo;s going to make any kick.
&rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause there ain&rsquo;t anything in the
revised regulations of the service as says a word
against it. So while we&rsquo;ve got to wait a spell for
the proper authority, according to my way of thinking,
an&rsquo; the rest of us are pretty much the same
mind, it&rsquo;s as good as fixed already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if thinking it was necessary to make some
reply, Benny nodded his head, but still continued
to gaze inquiringly from one to the other, for as yet
he failed to understand the alleged explanations,
and Dick Sawyer took it upon himself to throw
additional light on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t appear to me as if everything was just
plain to you, lad, an&rsquo; yet Joe straightened up what
Tom an&rsquo; Sam didn&rsquo;t get at. We settled the whole
thing last night after you&rsquo;d gone to bed, an&rsquo; the
way I look at it is, that it&rsquo;ll be as much of a favor
to us as to you an&rsquo; the dog, so there&rsquo;s no need to
feel as if you wasn&rsquo;t paying your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it Fluff and I are going to work?&rdquo;
Benny asked, after waiting an instant to learn if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
other member of the crew had an explanation to
make, and Tom Downey replied in a tone of
authority:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, right here, of course, lad. Ain&rsquo;t that
what we&rsquo;ve been telling you about? We&rsquo;re counting
on keeping you in the station, if it so be
authority is given from headquarters, and it don&rsquo;t
seem as if there could be any objection. You can
knock about pretty much as you please, though we
count that you&rsquo;ll help the cook, and keep the lamps
and lanterns trimmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fluff and I are to live right here?&rdquo; Benny cried
excitedly, in his excitement allowing the dog to
drop to the floor, where the latter set up a shrill
barking as if in approval of the plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as if you&rsquo;d be glad to stay,&rdquo; Sam
Hardy said in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad!&rdquo; Benny exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, you men
can&rsquo;t think how happy it will make Fluff and me!
Of course we was ready to leave, and wouldn&rsquo;t
have said a word against it, because we&rsquo;ve got our
living to earn; but you&rsquo;ve been so good to us that
it seems as if you was our own folks, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d have
been awful lonesome to go away where we didn&rsquo;t
know anybody. And you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be sorry, either,
if there&rsquo;s anything we can do to pay our way,
&rsquo;cause I know how to take care of the lamps, and
wait on the table, and&mdash;and&mdash;and I can wash dishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
just as well as a woman. I did it on the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>
all the voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re allowing that this &rsquo;ere is a case where
you regularly attend to your share of the duties,&rdquo;
Tom Downey said, speaking now in his official tone.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe in making paupers out of boys,
no matter whatever bad luck they&rsquo;ve fallen into;
but besides the work you&rsquo;ll do, I reckon it will be
kind of pleasant to have you and the dog laying
round here,&mdash;makes it seem more like home. Now,
Benny, you are to take hold from this out. Get up
when the cook does; do what you can to help him;
wash dishes and trim the lamps. After that the
time will be pretty much your own, an&rsquo; if it so be
that you can&rsquo;t sleep here, why we&rsquo;ll make a deal
with Eph Hannaford&rsquo;s folks so they&rsquo;ll give you
lodgings. But we won&rsquo;t talk about that part of it.
Turn to for breakfast now, and then there&rsquo;ll be a
chance to show how handy you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lump which came into Benny&rsquo;s throat at the
thought that he must leave the station had suddenly
taken its departure, and in obedience to the keeper&rsquo;s
orders the lad took his seat at the breakfast table
alone, for the crew had already broken their
fast.</p>

<p>Tom Downey observed that the boy moved the
chairs away from his immediate vicinity before sitting
down, and it was apparent to all that, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to Master Fluff&rsquo;s ideas, something had gone wrong,
for the dog danced about excitedly, giving vent
from time to time to a low yelp of what seemed to
be disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Fluff C. Foster?&rdquo; Sam
Hardy asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right after a spell,&rdquo; Benny replied.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll soon know the difference, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ll make
him understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understand what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, he always sat by the side of me
on board the ship, and he thinks it&rsquo;s funny he can&rsquo;t
do it now, I s&rsquo;pose; but he&rsquo;s a good, sensible dog,
and won&rsquo;t want to break over any rules after he gets
a little used to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let him sit by your side now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t be right. Mrs. Clark
said she&rsquo;d have a good deal of trouble to break him
of the habit after they got ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he behave himself?&rdquo; Keeper Downey
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fluff behave himself! Why, sir, he&rsquo;s just as
nice an&rsquo; polite at the table as any fellow you ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him a show, and let&rsquo;s see what he&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny pulled a chair by the side of the one in
which he was sitting, and without waiting for further
invitation the dog leaped into it, content at being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
by the side of his young master, and making no
effort to get at the food before him.</p>

<p>The crew watched with interest what was to them
very much like a performance gotten up for their
especial benefit, and during all the time Benny remained
at the table Fluff behaved himself with the
greatest propriety.</p>

<p>When the boy had satisfied his hunger he poured
a saucer one third full of coffee, broke into it a small
portion of bread, and Fluff immediately got down
from the chair, knowing that his meal was ready.</p>

<p>While the dog was eating Sam Hardy exclaimed,
as if the proceedings filled him with surprise:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got more sense than I ever gave a
dumb animal credit for havin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; so far as I&rsquo;m
concerned, he&rsquo;s welcome to sit at any table where
I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him a regular place by Benny&rsquo;s
side,&rdquo; Tom Downey added, and thus were the two
officially and formally received into the family of
the life savers.</p>

<p>The new member of the crew did not wait to be
told how he might make himself useful, but immediately
after the meal was ended he set about clearing
the table, washing dishes, and setting to rights the
interior of the station.</p>

<p>The men watched him curiously while he moved
quickly but noiselessly to and fro, until, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
swept the floor, he began dusting the different
articles of furniture, when Sam Hardy exclaimed
emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mark my word, that lad will be a big addition
to this &rsquo;ere place! He&rsquo;s tidy, willing, an&rsquo; quiet;
what more could we want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Keeper Downey replied in
a tone of content, and straightway the members of
the crew set about their several duties, satisfied that
they had made no mistake in assuming the guardianship
of Benny and Fluff.</p>

<p>The building was cleanly, when viewed from a
man&rsquo;s standpoint; but Benny, who had profited by
the teachings of Mrs. Clark, saw very much which
should be done, and from the time breakfast was
over until late in the afternoon he did not spend an
idle moment. As a matter of fact Fluff was equally
busy; when not exhibiting his tricks for the amusement
of the men, he was trudging to and fro at the
heels of his young master as if superintending the
labor, and blissfully ignorant of the fact that old
Maje sat outside displaying no slight jealousy and
anger because he had not been admitted to the
mess-room according to custom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It stands to reason that the old dog will be a
bit disagreeable at first,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said, as he
called attention to Maje in front of the tool-house.
&ldquo;We must introduce the two before long, and once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
they are friends it&rsquo;ll be more lively for Fluff C.
Foster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ring at the telephone which connected the
station with the neighboring city called Keeper
Downey into the adjoining room, and after receiving
a certain message he summoned Sam Hardy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;"><img id="ip_51" src="images/i059.jpg" width="428" height="259" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>&ldquo;The bodies are to be taken away this afternoon,
Sam. The coroner says the undertaker&rsquo;s team has
already started, so we can count on its being here
about sunset. Now there&rsquo;s no good reason why that
little shaver should see all the dismal work, for it
would only bring all the sorrow back into his heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go on patrol in half an hour; why wouldn&rsquo;t it
be a good idea to take him with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the tramp would be too long. You
see he&rsquo;s just come off shipboard, an&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t in good
trim for much walking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Cushing will come along, I reckon, an&rsquo; when
the boy begins to tire, can come back with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Sam. See to it that he&rsquo;s
wrapped up well, and give him a lift over the
roughest places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be feered but that I&rsquo;ll take good care of
him. What about the dog? Old Maje will make
short work of him if he ain&rsquo;t watched sharp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to that part of it, if Ben doesn&rsquo;t
want to take Fluff with him. Get ready, and don&rsquo;t
let Joe bring him back until the work here has been
finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new member of the crew was scouring knives
when Sam proposed that he go on the patrol, and
from the expression on his face it could readily be
seen that he was in favor of accepting the invitation;
but after a brief time of hesitation Benny replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go, Mr. Hardy; but there&rsquo;s so
much to be done here that I can&rsquo;t get away. It&rsquo;ll
be a good while before I&rsquo;m through with this job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark you, Benjamin: we count on your doing
the odd chores about the station; but don&rsquo;t reckon
every minute is to be spent working. You&rsquo;ve done
enough for one day, so get your duds together, an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll see what may be needed; it&rsquo;ll be a cold tramp
along the coast while the wind is howlin&rsquo; at this
rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Downey&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that part of it, my son. I&rsquo;ve
spoken with the keeper, an&rsquo; he thinks it&rsquo;ll do you
good to take a spin out of doors. What about
Fluff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I take him with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure; but I can&rsquo;t say the wind won&rsquo;t blow him
away; it&rsquo;s powerful strong, an&rsquo; he don&rsquo;t carry much
ballast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be glad enough to stay in my arms most
of the time,&rdquo; Benny cried gleefully as he went in
search of his reefer, which Joe Cushing, having been
given a hint by Tom Downey as to what was proposed,
had hung in front of the fire.</p>

<p>Had Benny taken all the clothing his &ldquo;guardians&rdquo;
offered to loan, it would have been literally impossible
for him to walk. He did accept, however, a
pair of rubber boots many sizes too large, a woollen
muffler, and a pair of mittens, and when these had
been adjusted according to the advice of all hands,
he looked like an animated bundle of clothing rather
than a living boy.</p>

<p>Fluff was disposed of under the large reefer, and
the party set out, Joe Cushing leading the way, with
Sam Hardy walking by Benny&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>The boy observed that each of his companions put
into his overcoat pocket a bar of wood, fashioned as
if intended to be used as a handle, and three small
packages looking not unlike sticks of soap, wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
in paper. He afterward came to know that these
last were Coston signals; that when a surfman finds
it necessary to show a light, he inserts one of the
packages or sticks into the wooden handle, and,
striking it against a rock, or any hard substance,
produces a brilliant light, many times more powerful
than the ordinary &ldquo;flare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to these signals the men hung over
their shoulders round leathern cases which looked
much like the covering of a small clock or a large
watch, and Sam Hardy said as they left the station:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m allowin&rsquo;, my son, you don&rsquo;t understand the
meanin&rsquo; of all this &rsquo;ere rigging; but keep your eyes
open, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll soon find out that we of the Service
have more on hand than sittin&rsquo; &rsquo;round taking our
ease, as a good many people credit us with doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going out just for a walk?&rdquo; Benny
asked, finding it difficult to make his way against the
strong, chilling wind which came in over the ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re out for a walk,&rdquo; Joe Cushing replied
with a hearty laugh; &ldquo;but it ain&rsquo;t for pleasure, my
son. No matter what the weather is, we&rsquo;re bound
to be on the move from sunset until sunrise, watching
for any craft that may be in distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A vessel couldn&rsquo;t get into trouble on the coast
to-night,&rdquo; Benny said, with the air of one who is
familiar with the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely not; but yet it is our business to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
on the watch day and night, because there&rsquo;s never
any telling when, or how, we may be needed, an&rsquo;
saving life in a storm ain&rsquo;t the only part of our work
by a long ways, as you&rsquo;ll come to know. I reckon
we&rsquo;re far enough from the station now, so there&rsquo;s
no fear of old Maje, an&rsquo; you can give Fluff C. Foster
a little run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny brought the dog out from under his coat,
and instantly he was on the ground Fluff set off,
barking joyously because of being free; but before
he had been left to his own devices twenty seconds
he began to howl as if in alarm.</p>

<p>The wind was literally blowing the little fellow
along, and, despite all his efforts, he was unable to
make headway against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hold his course,&rdquo; Sam said with a laugh,
&ldquo;and the worst of it is that there&rsquo;s no taking in sail
with him. That long hair gives the wind a good
hold, an&rsquo; I reckon young Foster will be glad to get
under your coat again, Benny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not until the dog had been blown landward over
the slope of the bluff which bordered the sea, was
his young master able to come up with him, and
once more beneath the lad&rsquo;s coat the little fellow
manifested his pleasure at having been rescued from
what probably seemed to him a dangerous position,
by half growling, half whining, which Benny explained
was &ldquo;the way Fluff talked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I counted on seeing heaps and heaps of snow,&rdquo;
the new member of the crew said in a tone of disappointment
as he trudged on between his companions.
&ldquo;Of course the winter in Calcutta isn&rsquo;t
like what it is here, and I don&rsquo;t remember much
about the drifts of which mother often spoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s snow and to spare, just back of the
timbered land,&rdquo; Sam Hardy replied with a laugh,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; when you&rsquo;re needin&rsquo; a sight of it mighty bad
you can go over the hill beyond the lighthouses.
Down here on the point, where the wind has full
sweep, it&rsquo;s mostly blown away. Now, for instance,
lookin&rsquo; up from the station, I reckon you won&rsquo;t see so
much as would make a snowball of respectable size.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we find it in spots down here,&rdquo; Joe Cushing
interrupted. &ldquo;Back of the rocks the wind packs it
into sheltered places, and although there&rsquo;s none to
be seen from the station door, we often come upon
drifts three or four feet deep. It&rsquo;s precious hard
work draggin&rsquo; the beach-wagon then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny soon had an illustration of his companions&rsquo;
statements. They had been walking over land
whereon not a single fleck of white could be seen,
when suddenly, coming upon a gully which was
sheltered from the wind by the cliffs, they were
floundering in a deposit of snow so deep that only
with the greatest difficulty could the boy force his
way through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a feast or a famine out here, lad,&rdquo;
Sam Hardy said grimly. &ldquo;No snow whatever, or
too much of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he led the way across what might have been
mistaken, save for the dead grass, for a summer
landscape.</p>

<p>The little party were not far from the station when
the men halted in front of a post to which was attached
a small iron receptacle containing a key,
fastened to a chain, and Sam said, as, removing his
mittens, he took this out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you shall see, my son, the meaning of this
&rsquo;ere bit of furniture we&rsquo;re obliged to carry. A dishonest
surfman might go a short distance from the
station, find a snug loafing-place, and spend his time
of duty there instead of patrolling the coast, if it
wasn&rsquo;t for the little telltale inside this case. We
must be at certain places in order to get at the keys
which fit the lock&mdash;in this wise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke Sam turned the key in what was
seemingly a tiny lock on the leathern case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside is a sort of clock which makes a record
whenever I turn the key. After we are back at the
station Tom Downey can tell if I have visited all
the points where the key is kept, and exactly what
time I was there. It makes a record for him to look
up, and is a satisfaction to me, because it proves I
have done my whole duty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>At nearly every point along the rugged coast Sam
and Joe had some story to tell of disaster, or of
saving life from the raging waters by the crew of
which Benny had good reason now to consider himself
a member.</p>

<p>Here, a schooner, having been dismasted, was
thrown up on the hidden reef which makes out some
distance from the land, and, during a furious storm
when the sleet and hail cut into the flesh like needles,
the life savers were forced to drag their apparatus
through the snowdrifts from two to four feet deep,
after which, by aid of the gun and the breeches-buoy,
every man was saved.</p>

<p>There, three boys, whose yacht had been capsized
by a sudden squall, would have drowned but for the
vigilance of the patrol and the activity of the men
who manned the life-boat, for the crew arrived at
the scene only barely in time to save them from
being dashed against the rocky cliffs.</p>

<p>It was as if every headland and cove had its own
particular story concerning the perils of the sea, and
the two surfmen, bent on so occupying the attention
of their companion that he should not note the passage
of time, gave to each incident such details as
could not fail of arresting the lad&rsquo;s attention, until
to his surprise Sam Hardy said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon, Joe, it&rsquo;s time for you to take the lad
back. It won&rsquo;t do to give him too much of a tramp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the first night. There&rsquo;s no need of spinning all our
yarns, for he&rsquo;s like to be with us on many a tour of
duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m neither tired nor cold,&rdquo; Benny said, for
this cutting short a most agreeable excursion was
not to his liking, although he made no protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t just the thing to drag you along here
when there&rsquo;s no real need of it, and I reckon you&rsquo;d
best turn back, my son. Joe will take you in behind
the pines, where you can give Fluff C. Foster
a chance to run, and by that time the frost will have
a good firm hold on your nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with a cheery &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; Sam continued
on his lonely, difficult way.</p>

<p>Joe fulfilled the promise made for him by his
comrade, and when, at nearly eight o&rsquo;clock, they
arrived within sight of the station, the surfman
began shouting, much to the surprise of his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right; you can come in,&rdquo; Keeper Downey
replied at length, and Joe Cushing knew that
those silent forms which had been lying in the boat-room
were no longer at the station.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">FROM THE &ldquo;AMAZONIA.&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>Benny was astir very early next morning, eager
to show the crew of the station that he appreciated
to the utmost their generosity in thus giving him a
home, and when the men came down to breakfast
the cook declared that the boy had performed considerably
more than half the work of preparing the
meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a handy lad around a kitchen, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; the best of the bargain in
adoptin&rsquo; him, providin&rsquo; he holds out as he&rsquo;s begun,&rdquo;
the cook said confidentially to Sam Hardy, and the
latter replied emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mark my words, cookee; he ain&rsquo;t the kind
of a lad who wears out quickly. I&rsquo;m countin&rsquo; on
his growin&rsquo; better every day, an&rsquo; before next winter
we&rsquo;ll make a surfman of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t take too many chances, Sam. That
little shaver ain&rsquo;t of the right build to knock around
in rough water with the likes of you, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s too
much danger in it for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you there, cookee. He&rsquo;s
spry as a kitten, an&rsquo; with grit enough to do anything
another can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit he&rsquo;d make a try for it; but I don&rsquo;t
want to see him pushed too far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny&rsquo;s entrance put an end to the conversation
for the time being, and following him, as a matter
of course, was Fluff C. Foster, who had become
sufficiently well acquainted with the men to greet
each in turn by sitting up and barking shrilly as he
held out one paw.</p>

<p>Every man shook hands with the little fellow,
after which he leaped up into the chair he had occupied
the day previous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knows his place like a little gentleman,&rdquo; Joe
Cushing cried in a tone of admiration as he stroked
the dog&rsquo;s silken hair, and Benny said apprehensively:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost afraid Fluff will get so much petting
that he&rsquo;ll forget his good manners. This very
morning he acted as if the whole station belonged
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he do, Benny?&rdquo; Keeper Downey
asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was determined to walk straight out of
doors, even though the big dog was sitting there
waiting to teach him better manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he been out yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. I carried him down by the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
where he could run around while I watched the other
dog.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 189px;"><img id="ip_62" src="images/i070.jpg" width="189" height="370" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>&ldquo;We must introduce him to Maje after breakfast,&rdquo;
Sam Hardy said, as he slyly gave Fluff a bit
of meat, and laughed until
the tears came into his
eyes as he watched the little
fellow trying to eat it
without betraying the fact
to Benny. &ldquo;Fluff C. Foster
has rights around this
station as well as Maje, an&rsquo;
they must be respected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the introduction
take too long,&rdquo;
Keeper Downey said
warningly. &ldquo;It is beach-apparatus
drill day, and too
much time must not be
wasted, because I&rsquo;m counting
on getting the boats out to have a look at what
is left of the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ceased speaking very suddenly as his gaze
rested on Benny; but the crew understood that it
was the keeper&rsquo;s purpose to overhaul such portions
of the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> as yet remained upon the rocks,
although it was hardly probable anything of value
would be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
After breakfast the cook would have excused
Benny from the task of washing dishes, so eager
were the men to witness the first meeting of the
dogs; but the new member of the crew begged permission
to perform his regular duties before indulging
in what was very like play.</p>

<p>Not until the kitchen was put in proper order did
Benny consider that he was at liberty to go out of
doors, even though all the men, save the keeper
himself, insisted that there was no good reason why
he should not take advantage of the cook&rsquo;s proposition.</p>

<p>Then, with Fluff under his arm, he went out back
of the station buildings, where, in a spot sheltered
from the wind, the crew was impatiently awaiting
his arrival.</p>

<p>Maje was present, appearing calmly indifferent to
the unusual amount of interest suddenly displayed
in him, but he pricked up his ears ominously on
seeing the white-haired visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s any danger he&rsquo;ll hurt
Fluff?&rdquo; Benny asked solicitously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that part of it,&rdquo; Sam Hardy
replied confidently. &ldquo;Maje knows as well as we do
that it&rsquo;s his duty to be polite to strangers, an&rsquo; if he
shows signs of forgettin&rsquo; it, we&rsquo;ll give him a lesson
that won&rsquo;t soon be forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t whip him, for then he&rsquo;d always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
remember that Fluff got him into trouble, an&rsquo; never
would be friendly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let young Foster down, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll look after
Maje,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said as he grasped the big dog&rsquo;s
collar.</p>

<p>There was a look of anxiety on Benny&rsquo;s face as
he gave Fluff his freedom, and saw the little fellow
walk directly up to Maje in the most reckless
fashion.</p>

<p>The big dog condescended to sniff at the impudent
visitor, and then he turned his head away, as if to
say that such small game was entirely beneath his
notice. Nor was it possible to persuade him into
paying any further attention to the guest, and after
several fruitless efforts Joe Cushing said with just a
shade of disappointment in his tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your introduction hasn&rsquo;t turned out much of
an affair after all, Sam. I allowed we might see
some sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon Maje has seen Fluff too often, for I&rsquo;ve
caught him looking in when the doors were
open. Most likely he&rsquo;s made up his mind that
young Foster has come to stay, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t intend
to pay any attention to him. You can let your
dog have the run of the station from this out
Benny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did really seem that there was no reason to fear
Maje might be tempted to do mischief, and Benny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
turned to go into the building, for the lamps and
lanterns were yet to be trimmed.</p>

<p>The men arose to attend to the varied duties of
the day, and for an instant the attention of all was
diverted from the animals.</p>

<p>It was as if Maje had been waiting for just such
an opportunity. In a twinkling, and with an agility
that one would hardly have given him credit for, he
seized Fluff by the neck, tossing him like a ball
several feet in the air.</p>

<p>This done, he walked away quickly, evidently
knowing what would be the result if he lingered
there many seconds.</p>

<p>Fluff howled dismally while he was yet in the air,
and, once on his feet again, ran to Benny for protection,
grumbling and whimpering as if making
complaint against such uncourteous treatment.</p>

<p>Sam Hardy and Joe Cushing turned instantly to
pursue Maje; but Benny, holding Fluff tightly in
his arms, begged of them not to punish the big dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s jealous, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll only make him
worse if you whip him. Please let him alone; I&rsquo;m
certain Fluff isn&rsquo;t hurt any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He howled as if his throat was cut,&rdquo; Sam said
laughingly, as he relinquished the pursuit in accordance
with Benny&rsquo;s request, and Joe Cushing set
about examining Fluff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got so much as a scratch,&rdquo; was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
report. &ldquo;I reckon the worst that came to him was
a big scare, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t wonder at his bein&rsquo; a bit
afraid after such a rough handling.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;"><img id="ip_66" src="images/i074.jpg" width="427" height="397" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll teach him to keep out of Maje&rsquo;s way, and
perhaps it&rsquo;s a good thing, for he always was too inquisitive
and impudent,&rdquo; Benny replied, but he took
good care his pet should not receive another lesson
that forenoon, for he set his dog in a chair, sternly
commanding him to remain there until further
orders.</p>

<p>The cook was determined his assistant should
have ample opportunity of witnessing the beach-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>apparatus
drill, and as soon as the men had taken
their stations he insisted upon Benny&rsquo;s going into
the boat-room, where everything was in readiness.</p>

<p>The beach-wagon is a two-wheeled vehicle not
unlike a huge push-cart, and on it are loaded all the
implements necessary for sending out to a wreck
and hauling the distressed mariners ashore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;"><img id="ip_67" src="images/i075.jpg" width="433" height="326" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Both the boy and the dog appeared to be deeply
interested when the wagon was drawn out on the
level ground in the rear of the station, where was
erected an imitation of a ship&rsquo;s mast. A short distance
from this spar the wagon was brought to a
standstill, and out of it taken a small cannon. The
crew loaded the weapon with powder and a missile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
to which was attached a thin line that had been
wound on pegs in a wooden case known as a faking-box,
in such fashion that it would unwind without
resistance or snarling.</p>

<p>The cannon was aimed at the imitation mast, and
discharged, the shot carrying the line directly across
the top, where was a man standing to represent a
mariner in distress.</p>

<p>The supposititious shipwrecked sailor drew in on
the thin line as if working for life, and soon brought
over the top a stouter rope, sufficient to sustain the
weight of a human being.</p>

<p>When this had been made fast both on the spar
and near the cart, the man was drawn down exactly
as one would be pulled ashore from a wreck.</p>

<p>The work had been performed exactly as if human
lives were really in danger, and Benny received his
first lesson in life-saving, but not his last, for he
soon had ample opportunity of seeing the crew work
when it appeared as if both they and those whom
they sought to save, would be swept into eternity by
the angry waters.</p>

<p>After the apparatus had been repacked in the
wagon, the casting-line carefully rewound on the
pegs that it might be in perfect order when it should
again be needed, and orders were given to make
ready with the boat, Benny returned to the kitchen,
where the cook was already at work preparing dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to that sort of thing, for
it&rsquo;s pretty much all drill out here, except when the
weather is bad.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;"><img id="ip_69" src="images/i077.jpg" width="433" height="381" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>&ldquo;I should think they&rsquo;d soon know it so well that
there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need of doing so much work,&rdquo;
Benny replied, as he set about paring the potatoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; the cook said with a laugh; &ldquo;but
just read these &rsquo;ere rules and regulations on &lsquo;Drill
and Exercise,&rsquo; an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll see that men at life-saving
stations ain&rsquo;t allowed to spend very much idle time.
All that&rsquo;s set down there is to be gone through with
every day, in addition to patrolling the shore, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
as you have seen already, ain&rsquo;t child&rsquo;s play. Not
that I&rsquo;m grumblin&rsquo; about the work, for it&rsquo;s well
the boys are kept out of idleness; but this will show
how hard they&rsquo;ve got to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cook handed Benny a thin, black-covered
book bearing the title <i class="cite">Revised Regulations</i>, and on
the page exposed to view the lad read the lines
given below:</p>

<p>&ldquo;168. The following weekly routine of drill, etc.,
will be observed during the first month of the active
season at all regularly manned stations in the Service:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Practice with beach-apparatus and
overhaul and examine all apparatus and gear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Practice with surf and life-boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Practice with signals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Practice with beach-apparatus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Practice resuscitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Clean house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the first month the practice with beach-apparatus
on Monday may be omitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;169. Whenever the regular practice is prevented
by wreck duty, stormy weather, or high surf,
it must take place the first opportunity thereafter.
Whenever practice is so prevented, the fact must be
entered upon the journal, with full particulars of
the cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;170. No wilful neglect on the part of the keepers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
to practice their crews, as directed in the foregoing
routine, will be tolerated, and the officers of
the district are required to permit none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;171. By practice with the beach-apparatus is
meant the mustering of the crew, the recital by each
member of his particular duty, and the rigging of
the gear over a distance of seventy-five yards from
sand-anchor to wreck-pole, according to the method
set forth in the beach-apparatus drill. Powder must
be used in every case, and the practice, so far as
practicable, be precisely the same as at a wreck,
using the apparatus upon the carriage, excepting
the long whip. If necessary, to preserve the hawser,
a coil of rope may be taken to the practice
ground, and placed at the rear of the carriage, and
used in its stead. If a practising shot-line is used,
it must be removed from pins, and fired from the
box precisely as in actual service. The use of powder
will be dispensed with when the supply on hand
is reduced to three pounds, at which time the district
superintendent or resident assistant inspector
will be notified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;172. Boat practice will consist in launching and
landing through the surf, and at least one half-hour&rsquo;s
exercise of the men in handling their oars, as directed
in the prescribed boat-drill. Going off and landing
through the surf will not be sufficient to enter upon
the journal as practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
&ldquo;173. Practice of resuscitation will consist in
each member of the crew repeating the rules, as
hereinafter provided, using the words of the book,
and afterwards illustrating them by manipulations
upon the succeeding member of the crew. Thus,
the keeper will work upon Surfman No. 1, No. 1
upon No. 2, etc., and No. 7 upon the keeper.
At the close of this exercise the keeper will open
the medicine-chest, and question each man upon the
uses of the remedies contained therein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;174. Practice with the International Code
Signals will consist in questions by the keeper to
each member of the crew upon the colors of the
different flags, the definitions of the two-, three-,
and four-flag hoists and the distinguishing flag or
pennant of each, the part of the code-book necessary
to turn to when reading and when making a
signal, etc., and in actual conversation or communication
by means of the miniature signals provided
for each station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;175. In fine weather signals and books may be
borrowed for one day from the adjacent station, and
by erecting a temporary pole, the crew practised in
the use of flags, which will fix the method of their
use in the mind more effectively than any other
practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;176. No departure from the prescribed drill for
the use of the beach-apparatus in any of its details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
will be made by district superintendents or other
officers without the sanction of the General Superintendent,
previously obtained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny read all this carefully, as if trying to fix
the whole upon his memory, and then asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the &lsquo;active season&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we begin work in the fall. You
must know that all the crew don&rsquo;t stay here during
the summer. The active season is from September
1st to May 1st; but the keeper holds on the year
round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a surfman?&rdquo; Benny asked after a
pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my son, I&rsquo;m only the cook, and hired by
the men, instead of the Government, so you see I
don&rsquo;t come in for all these long hours. My work is
no harder in stormy weather, while then it is that
every other man is on duty all the time. I have
seen this same crew worked forty hours on a stretch,
wet to the skin and half frozen, with never a single
word of complaint. They are just putting off in the
surf-boat, and I reckon it would be worth your while
to watch them, Benny. We&rsquo;ve got the dinner so
far along that there&rsquo;s nothing to be done for a spell,
so you and Fluff C. Foster had best stay out in the
open air while you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad had a strong desire to see the crew afloat,
otherwise he might not have taken advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
permission while there was any work to be performed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;"><img id="ip_74" src="images/i082.jpg" width="432" height="369" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Fluff had remained in the chair like an obedient
dog that he could be when so disposed; but he came
down after the fashion of an exceedingly small and
very white whirlwind at the first word from his
master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful that old Maje ain&rsquo;t layin&rsquo; anywhere
outside on the watch,&rdquo; the cook cried; but Benny
believed there was no necessity for him to be over-cautious
regarding the safety of his pet. Fluff&rsquo;s
experience with the big dog had been such that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
did not intend giving Maje another opportunity of
playing ball with him; he marched sedately and
very close at Benny&rsquo;s heels from the station, down
to that point on the shore overlooking the reef on
which the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> had gone to pieces.</p>

<p>It was the first time the lad had seen the wreck of
the ship which served him as a home during so many
months, because every member of the crew had
taken especial care to prevent his wandering in that
direction.</p>

<p>On this morning the men most likely believed
Benny would be employed in the kitchen, and, perhaps,
expected the cook would prevent him from
going out on the shore; but if the latter had thought
of the matter at all, it was probably with the idea
that the boy must at some time see the small portion
of the ship which remained on the rocks, and as well
then as at any other.</p>

<p>At all events, he allowed his assistant to go out as
has been seen, and instantly Benny came in view of
these vestiges of disaster all the sorrow of the past
came over him like a flood, drowning for the time
being every other thought save of that night, when
he alone out of all the ship&rsquo;s company came safely
to land.</p>

<p>Seated upon the rocks he buried his face in Fluff&rsquo;s
silken hair, and gave way once more to his grief.
Then, the outburst of tears having in a measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
soothed him, he looked out upon the frowning reef
whereon the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> ended her cruise.</p>

<p>The forward portion of the dismembered hull,
with the foremast still standing, and a few timbers
of the after portion, was all that remained to tell of
the stately vessel which had plowed her way through
so many oceans only to meet with disaster when
virtually within sight of the home port.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do for us to be crying all the time,
Fluff, else the crew will get tired, and think perhaps
we&rsquo;d better find some other job; but we shall keep
on feeling sorry just so long as we live because the
captain and Mrs. Clark didn&rsquo;t come ashore with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was his own words which reminded Benny of
the fact that the bodies of those who had been
drowned would, in the ordinary course of events, be
washed ashore, and at the very moment this came
into his mind he saw the life-saving crew taking
from the wreckage what was unquestionably a
human body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fluff, Fluff, it may be our captain that
they have found! We can&rsquo;t stay here and see them
bring him ashore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hugging the dog so tightly that the little fellow
uttered a low cry of protest, Benny ran back to the
station, and there it was necessary to explain to the
cook why his eyes were red and swollen from weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
&ldquo;No, my son, it&rsquo;s not the captain&rsquo;s body they
have found, for that was carried into the city last
night, together with the remains of his wife and
some of the sailors. You were sent out on patrol
with Sam Hardy and Joe Cushing so you shouldn&rsquo;t
see what was being done; but it had to be known,
and now it is as good a time as any other for you to
be told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny tried unsuccessfully to check his tears, and
the cook, observing the struggle, said in a kindly
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, lad; you&rsquo;ve had in your short life
a good bit of sadness, an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t to be wondered at
that this last blow comes mighty tough. Now take
my advice, and have a solid cry. Go back into the
thicket, for there&rsquo;s no need of your seein&rsquo; what the
crew will bring ashore, if it so be you were not mistaken
about what was taken from the wreck. Go
back into the thicket with the dog, and stay there
till I call you for dinner. It&rsquo;ll help you out, and
prevent some ugly sights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny hesitated. This running away from work
in order to spare himself additional sorrow was not
to his mind manly, and he feared lest those who had
constituted themselves his guardians might censure
him for so doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling bad; but that ain&rsquo;t any
reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t stay where I belong, for no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
matter how much work I do, it won&rsquo;t be possible to
pay Fluff&rsquo;s board and mine. I think perhaps I ought
to hold on right here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as I tell you, my boy. I&rsquo;ll explain to the
men when they come in, and you may be certain
that the keeper himself would give the same advice
in the form of an order, if he was ashore. There&rsquo;s
no reason to take more bitter things in this life than
is necessary; so be off with you, and I&rsquo;ll answer for
it that Fluff C. Foster won&rsquo;t object to a tramp
through the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny could do no less than act upon this suggestion,
which was at the same time a command, and
with Fluff under his arm he set off, not daring to
turn his head seaward lest he should see the crew
engaged in their gruesome work.</p>

<p>Once within the shelter of the pine trees, where
patches of brown moss could be seen here and there,
much to the delight of Fluff, Benny gave way to
his gloomy thoughts until the antics of the dog,
overjoyed at having this opportunity for a scamper
after so many months of life on shipboard, aroused
him from his mournful revery.</p>

<p>Then, and he blamed himself most severely for
finding it possible to do other than mourn at such a
time, he yielded to the dog&rsquo;s mute entreaties, and
the two ran here and there under the trees, the low
moaning of the murderous surf alone breaking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
silence, until the cook&rsquo;s cries told that the noon-day
meal was ready.</p>

<p>When Benny answered the summons the boat-room
door was closed, and he believed this had
been done to shut out from view those forms which
had come ashore from the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">ROUTINE DUTY.</span></h2>

<p>During the three days which elapsed after the
crew began work on the wreck Benny found sufficient
with which to occupy his time.</p>

<p>From early morning until after dinner he was
engaged in the kitchen, or in setting to rights the
different apartments of the station, and the result of
his work was soon apparent. Never before during
the active season had the interior of the building
been so cleanly, and the men were delighted with
the agreeable change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re what might be called an A 1 housekeeper,
Benjamin,&rdquo; Tom Downey said one day as
he returned to the station unexpectedly and found
the lad washing the floor of the sleeping room.
&ldquo;All hands of us turn to and clean up once a week,
according to the rules and regulations, but somehow
we don&rsquo;t get it as neat as you do, and it&rsquo;s littered
up in great shape forty-eight hours later. Now,
everything is bright and clean as a new pin, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
reckon we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; the best of this guardianship
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad if you think I&rsquo;m paying our board,
sir,&rdquo; Benny replied, pleased because of the praise
bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing more than that, my lad, an&rsquo; we
must hit upon some plan of squaring matters. A
lad who takes it upon himself to see that our outside
clothing is properly dried after we come in from a
day&rsquo;s work is worth considerably more than what
he and an imitation dog can eat, to say nothing of
the other duties you have assumed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be as pleased to have me here as I am
to stay, it&rsquo;ll be a big thing for Fluff an&rsquo; me, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I allow matters are about in that shape already,
and we&rsquo;ll see if something in the way of an allowance
can&rsquo;t be made for the extra work you&rsquo;re
doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you&rsquo;ll pay me money, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the boys are talking about. You
see we count on your going to school next season,
and you must have a nest-egg before then, in order
to pay your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather it shouldn&rsquo;t be done, sir,&rdquo; Benny
replied gravely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty good of you to say
I&rsquo;m helpin&rsquo; along; but I&rsquo;m sure this kind of work
isn&rsquo;t worth more than our board. If the men
would be willing to teach me the rules of the service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
and let me join in the drill sometimes, I&rsquo;d be
glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea in doing that, Benjamin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I knew how to handle a boat in the surf, and
could go through the drill, perhaps I might get a
job as a surfman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Downey laughed loudly, until noting the
red flush which crept over the lad&rsquo;s face, when he
checked his mirth suddenly, as he said seriously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not much bigger than a peanut, Benny,
and I&rsquo;m afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t cut any figger in a
boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m bound to grow, sir. Of course I
couldn&rsquo;t do anything of the kind now, but after a
spell perhaps I&rsquo;ll be big enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to get into the service, lad?
Every member of a crew takes his life in his hand
when there&rsquo;s work to be done, and you&rsquo;ve already
had a chance to see that the duties are not only
dangerous, but severe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but whenever you save a man from
drowning it must make you feel mighty good, and
that squares up for all the hard work. I&rsquo;d rather
be a regular member of the crew than anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That comes of your having been thrown among
us; but once you go out into the world you&rsquo;ll have
different ideas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen quite a bit of it already, sir, and never
thought so much of what I might be able to do,&rdquo;
Benny replied meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit, lad, that you&rsquo;ve knocked around
considerable for one of your age&mdash;seen more of the
world than any of us; but&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,
Benny, you shall learn the drill, and when spring
comes we&rsquo;ll show you how to handle a boat, although
I&rsquo;m not certain any of the crew would agree
to your entering this branch of the service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation came to an end at this point for
the time being, so far as Benny was concerned; but
when Tom Downey had an opportunity of speaking
privately with the crew, he repeated all that had
been said, treating the matter as if it gave him no
slight degree of pleasure because the lad was inclined
to enter the service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for it he shall know how to handle a
surf-boat &rsquo;twixt now and next summer,&rdquo; Sam Hardy
said decidedly. &ldquo;That boy has got sand, an&rsquo; a
good deal of it, else he&rsquo;d never worked in as he has
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If his mind is set on such a life, I&rsquo;m another as
will help the little whifflet along,&rdquo; Joe Cushing
added with a laugh, and although no lengthy discussion
was indulged in at the time, all the crew
appeared to consider it as settled that Benny should
be instructed in the duties of life-saving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
It is not to be supposed that the boy worked
every moment of daylight. After the dishes used
at dinner had been washed, the cook insisted that
he go out of doors with Fluff, and the pine grove
was his favorite playground. Here, despite the cold
weather, he roamed to and fro while the dog chased
imaginary squirrels and his own shadow, until the
frosty air drove both inside the station again.</p>

<p>It was while he was enjoying his &ldquo;outing&rdquo; that
the bodies lately recovered from the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> were
removed by the coroner, and Benny asked no questions
concerning them. There was in his mind the
fear that by speaking of the wreck, when it would
be impossible to control his sorrow, he might displease
those who were so kind, and all this he kept
a secret from every one save Fluff.</p>

<p>When he was alone with the dog, however, and
the moaning and roaring of the surf told of what
had been done on that forbidding coast, he poured
out all his heart to Fluff, and those who had gone
into the Unknown from the decks of the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>
had at least one sincere mourner.</p>

<p>Each evening Benny accompanied one or the other
of the men on patrol duty, and appeared to take the
liveliest interest at all times in watching for signs of
some craft in distress. At every convenient opportunity
during the day he visited the lookout on the
bluff, and when not otherwise engaged pored over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
the regulations of the service until, as Joe Cushing
said, he believed the lad &ldquo;could come near to repeating
every word in the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During three days of pleasant weather the crew
brought on shore the little which could be saved
from what remained of the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>, and the men
had settled down to a round of routine duty.</p>

<p>It was Sam Hardy&rsquo;s turn to begin the patrol work
of the night, and, much to Benny&rsquo;s satisfaction, he
called upon the lad to accompany him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; it will be your last chance for
some time, according to the indications, and I&rsquo;ll
set myself down as a Dutchman if we don&rsquo;t have a
blow &rsquo;twixt now and mornin&rsquo; that will go ahead of
anything you ever saw on this coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that Fluff C. Foster was well acquainted with
the members of the crew, Benny did not consider it
necessary to carry his pet whenever he went out,
therefore the dog was left behind, and, well wrapped
in thick clothing, Benny set off, having received the
assurance from Sam that he would be allowed to
share in the entire four hours of duty.</p>

<p>The wind had increased in force until it was difficult
to make one&rsquo;s way over the bold headlands
through the snow, and more than once did Sam
Hardy find it necessary to seek a shelter while he
rested from the severe labor.</p>

<p>An unusually vigilant watch was kept over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
broad expanse of waters, for this was a time when
the life savers along the coast knew their services
would most likely be needed. There would probably
be some vessels, through carelessness, ignorance,
or mishap, in distress, and whatever of peril
might await them, the men of the service must be
prepared to put off in their boats for a battle with
the raging waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This wind is gettin&rsquo; into shape for a regular
tearer,&rdquo; Sam said when the two, partially sheltered
by the rocks, stood peering out over the heaving
waters. &ldquo;Them as are outside to-morrow morning
will do well to see that they have plenty of sea-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Already had the first particles of snow begun to
fall, and the air was rapidly growing colder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t often we have two big storms so near
together; but it&rsquo;s coming this time, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m mistaken
if we don&rsquo;t have plenty of work before the sun
sets to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible you could see very far
after it begins to snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t, lad, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a fact; but I allow
our eyes do better service than those that haven&rsquo;t
been trained to the work. There&rsquo;s Dick Sawyer,
for instance, he&rsquo;s by far the best man among us in
this kind of work. I&rsquo;ve been with him when it
seemed as if he smelled a vessel, for he&rsquo;s struck his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
signal when I couldn&rsquo;t see six inches before my
nose, an&rsquo; I never knew him to go wrong. But we
can&rsquo;t loaf here much longer if we count on covering
our beat in the regulation time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as if the storm had begun without warning.
The first particles had no more than fallen when the
air seemed thick with swirling wreaths that struck
the skin like needle-points, and were forced by the
increasing wind through every aperture in one&rsquo;s
clothing.</p>

<p>Benny found it necessary to shield his eyes, because
of the pain caused by the icy particles, and
could give little heed to his footsteps, but followed
directly behind his companion.</p>

<p>Sam, on the contrary, appeared to suffer no
especial inconvenience; he kept constant watch
over the sea, although at times it was necessary to
cover his eyes, and breasted his way against the wind
as if finding real pleasure in the struggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you came to-night, lad,&rdquo; he said
when they paused for an instant. &ldquo;My idea was
that this flurry would hold off till past midnight, or
you wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance to show your
nose outside the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been sorry if you hadn&rsquo;t let me come,
&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ll never make any fist at being a surfman
by staying under cover all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my plan to coddle you up, Benjamin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
but at the same time there&rsquo;s no good reason why
you should get it quite so tough at the start. You
won&rsquo;t learn much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam paused as, sheltering his eyes, he gazed
steadily seaward, and Benny tried in vain to discover
what had thus attracted his companion&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<p>During fully a minute the surfman stood immovable
as a statue, regardless of the howling wind and
stinging snow, and then muttered half to himself, as
he drew from his pocket one of the Coston signals:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The work has begun sooner than I counted on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Benny asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a three-masted schooner less than a
mile away, I should say, and doing her best to crawl
off from the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny strained his eyes to pierce the fleecy cloud
which enveloped him; but nothing save the swirling
wreaths could be distinguished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out anything,&rdquo; he exclaimed in a
tone of regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it ain&rsquo;t to be wondered at, lad. Wait
until you&rsquo;ve been on patrol duty a dozen nights
like this, and you&rsquo;ll find it a different matter. I
can see the schooner now an&rsquo; then, an&rsquo; allow she&rsquo;s
got a fore-staysail, reefed foresail, and spanker set;
but don&rsquo;t seem to be crawling off very fast. We&rsquo;ll
let her know that the crew at this station ain&rsquo;t
asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>While speaking he had inserted the signal in its
wooden handle, and as he concluded, struck it
sharply against a rock.</p>

<p>There was a crackling and spitting of fire for an
instant, after which the light burned out with apparently
almost as much brilliancy as that displayed
from the lighthouse a short distance away, and the
glare literally blinded Benny.</p>

<p>When it died away the night seemed yet darker
than before, and the lad peered straight ahead in
the direction pointed out by Sam until he fancied
he saw a tiny flare appear and disappear at brief
intervals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have seen us,&rdquo; Sam said in a tone of satisfaction.
&ldquo;That wisp of flame was their answer,
and I allow by its having been given so quickly that
all hands understand they&rsquo;d better have headed for
deep water sooner. Word must be taken to the
station, and I&rsquo;m doubtful about leavin&rsquo; here. I
wonder could you find your way back, Benny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I could, and I&rsquo;ll be mighty glad of
the chance to try. What shall I tell the keeper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so certain that I&rsquo;ve got any right to
let you take the chances, for in this storm a lad who
is green at the business can easily get bewildered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Benny replied quickly. &ldquo;Please let
me go, Mr. Hardy, for it&rsquo;ll show that I can be of
some little help in the work, and perhaps the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
will think I may be a surfman in time, even if I am
small.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall make the venture, my boy. Do you
hear that whistle now and then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been hearing it for some time, sir.
There must be a steamer near by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless your soul, Benny, haven&rsquo;t you
found out by this time that there&rsquo;s a steam fog-horn
near the lighthouse. I counted on their setting
it going when this smother first gave signs of
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny remembered now that the cook had pointed
out to him a small brick building painted white,
which had at one side a curiously shaped funnel,
and told him this last was the fog-horn; but other
matters were occupying his mind at the time, and
he gave little heed to the information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep straight on after that sound,&rdquo; Sam said
as he saw to it that Benny&rsquo;s coat was closely buttoned.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to travel too fast, for there&rsquo;s
plenty of time. Even if that craft comes to grief,
she won&rsquo;t strike inside of an hour. When you get
to the station there&rsquo;s nothing to be done save tell
the keeper what we&rsquo;ve seen, and that the schooner
lays off Skinner&rsquo;s Point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I come back, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back through this storm, Benny? Why,
you&rsquo;re crazy! There&rsquo;s such a thing as learning a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
surfman&rsquo;s duties; but attempting to find me out
here in this swirl ain&rsquo;t one of &rsquo;em. Even if I was
fool enough to say you might try it, the rest of the
crew would take good care you didn&rsquo;t get outside
the station again. Now be off, lad, and keep your
wits well about you. Remember that you&rsquo;ll bring
up nearabout the building if you follow the sound
of the whistle.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;"><img id="ip_91" src="images/i099.jpg" width="428" height="388" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Benny was proud indeed as he began what unquestionably
was, for a person unfamiliar with the locality,
a perilous journey.</p>

<p>There was in his mind the knowledge that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
taking some slight part in the work of life-saving,
and that by his making this venture Sam Hardy
could remain on duty where he might possibly be
of great assistance to those who were in danger.</p>

<p>To push on alone over the rocks, through drifts of
snow, beaten and buffeted by the wind, and half
blinded by the icy particles, was entirely different
from following behind Sam. Previously he had been
partially sheltered by the surfman&rsquo;s body; but now
it was necessary to breast the storm alone, and there
were many times when he found it literally impossible
to proceed, for the wind came in spiteful gusts
that nearly threw him from his feet.</p>

<p>Many times did he unconsciously turn aside from
the direct course, and when the whistle sounded
again he was forced to make a detour in this direction
or that, at the cost of many additional steps.
Then again it was as if the heavy booming came
from all sides, and save for the fact that he remained
motionless until the force of the wind lessened, he
might have lost his way completely.</p>

<p>Although the air was bitterly cold Benny was
hardly aware of the fact; the severe labor of making
his way through the drifts and against the blasts
warmed his body until he perspired even at the
same time that his hands and face were chilled by
the frost.</p>

<p>When he came upon the light of the station, suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
as it were, it appeared to him as if a full hour
must have been spent in the journey, and now that
the task was accomplished it seemed impossible he
could have continued on five minutes longer.</p>

<p>There was no need for him to explain why he had
returned alone. The waiting crew, fearing news of
disaster, understood at once that Sam Hardy would
not have sent the boy back unless he had grave
reasons for doing so, and before Benny could speak
Dick Sawyer cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you seen, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny understood that his report should be made
to the keeper, and, therefore, instead of answering
Sawyer&rsquo;s question, he turned to Mr. Downey, describing
what Hardy had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off Skinner&rsquo;s Point, eh?&rdquo; Downey said as he
took from the pegs where it was hanging, his suit of
oiled clothing. &ldquo;How far away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hardy said about a mile; but I didn&rsquo;t see
any sign of a vessel, except when the little light
showed itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to go on patrol more than once,
lad,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said with a laugh, &ldquo;before you&rsquo;ll
make much of a fist at seeing a craft a mile away on
such a night as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get so I can in time, if you allow me to go
out on patrol,&rdquo; Benny replied confidently, and then,
turning to the keeper, he added, &ldquo;Mr. Hardy said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
I wasn&rsquo;t to come back; but if there&rsquo;s any message
you&rsquo;d like sent him, sir, I&rsquo;m certain I can carry it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you be willing to go through this storm
from here to Skinner&rsquo;s Point when there was no
real need of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was a chance I might be of service,
I&rsquo;d be glad to, sir, and, besides, such work as that
would be helping me along in learning a surfman&rsquo;s
duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems a cruel thing to do,&rdquo; Downey said half
to himself; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve a mind to let you go with
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only would, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about leavin&rsquo; Fluff C. Foster alone? All
hands of us, except the cook, must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fluff will behave himself, I&rsquo;m certain, for he
doesn&rsquo;t make any trouble when I tell him he must
stay alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thaw yourself a bit by the fire while we&rsquo;re
getting the beach-wagon out, and then you shall do
your share of the work, unless it so chances we&rsquo;re
forced to launch the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During this time every member of the crew had
been preparing for the arduous labor before him,
and the men were in readiness when Keeper Downey
led the way toward the door.</p>

<p>Benny had no idea of spending valuable time in
front of the fire. He delayed only an instant to pet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Fluff, and whisper in the dog&rsquo;s ear that it was necessary
he remain inside the building quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I&rsquo;m going to take my first lesson as a
surfman, Fluffy, and it&rsquo;s as much to your interest
as mine that I do it, because we&rsquo;ve got to pay our
way somehow, and it can&rsquo;t always be done by
washing dishes and clearing up the house. Now be
a good dog, and don&rsquo;t go outside, for you&rsquo;d surely
get lost in the snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Benny replenished the fire, throwing on
sufficient coal to keep it glowing several hours at
least, and, closing the door behind him lest Fluff
should be tempted to disobey his command, joined
the men at the door of the boat-room.</p>

<p>Four of the crew were putting the drag-ropes over
their shoulders; Joe Cushing and Keeper Downey
were at the handles, although had the full crew been
present Sam would have occupied the position which
was now filled by the keeper, and the latter&rsquo;s station
would have been at the rear of the cart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall take my place, Benny, which is behind.
Don&rsquo;t exert yourself to push too strongly;
but you may pull back the best you know how when
we are going downhill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be little holding back needed through
this snow,&rdquo; Joe said with a cheery laugh, such as
he might have indulged in had they been setting
out on some pleasure excursion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Benny had studied a diagram in the <i class="cite">Revised
Regulations</i>, showing how the beach-wagon should
be manned, as given below, therefore knew exactly
what were his duties.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;"><img id="ip_96" src="images/i104.jpg" width="282" height="144" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>He heeded not the excessive labor which was before
them in dragging the cart more than half a mile
over the rocks and through the snow-drifts, because
of the proud satisfaction which was his in thus being
allowed to share the duties of the men.</p>

<p>The crew set off at a slow pace. It was reasonable
to suppose, however imminent the danger which
threatened the schooner, that some considerable
time must elapse before they could begin the work of
life-saving, and it was necessary to husband their
strength because of the difficult and protracted task
before them.</p>

<p>Benny asked himself, even as they started, how it
would be possible to drag the heavy wagon over the
course traversed by the patrol, for he knew that in
many places they would be forced to clamber up
cliff-like masses of rocks, and again drag the wagon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
through the drifts of snow that under other circumstances
would seem impassable.</p>

<p>The crew, however, appeared to give no heed to
the difficulties in the way; but set out on this journey
which, fatiguing as it must be, was but the
beginning of their night of work.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">SAVING LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>The men pressed forward, dragging the heavy
load steadily, but at moderate speed.</p>

<p>Keeper Downey was too good a captain to urge
his crew to their utmost efforts at the beginning of
the journey, lest he exhaust them before the task
was accomplished. He also knew that their services
were not needed immediately, otherwise Sam Hardy
would have burned another signal, and again, a conclusion
much to be desired, the vessel might succeed
in working off from the dangerous situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slow and sure is better than rapid and uncertain,&rdquo;
the keeper shouted cheerily, and Benny was
surprised that the crew should appear almost eager
for the work, which, under the most favoring circumstances
in case the schooner struck, would be
severe and attended with great suffering. He shivered
as he realized that perhaps soon the clothing
of these brave fellows, wet with spray, would be
converted into an armor of ice, which they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
wear as best they might on this bitter winter&rsquo;s night
until the task of life-saving was accomplished, or
proven to be fruitless.</p>

<p>The cheeriness of the men was by no means allied
to mirth. They were setting out, perchance, to
battle face to face with death, and realized to the
utmost all the dangers and the suffering which
awaited them. It could also be told, from a certain
manner apparent in all, that their thoughts were
with those poor fellows whose craft was drifting on
to the cruel rocks, rather than upon the possible
labor which might be demanded of them.</p>

<p>Now and then as they paused for an instant, while
making ready to haul the wagon over some miniature
cliff, one of the crew referred to the anxiety which
must be in the hearts of those aboard the schooner,
and another expressed satisfaction that the imperilled
mariners knew there were on the shore waiting
to succor them, men who were provided with
every known method for saving life under such circumstances.</p>

<p>All the while as these men spoke one with another
evincing anxiety for strangers, they were fighting
against the furious wind and driving particles of
frost, and even at times, when their way lay near
the water&rsquo;s edge, against the volumes of surf which
were flung landward by the angry blasts.</p>

<p>There was no moment when the progress was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
other than extremely difficult, and Benny was absolutely
obliged at times to allow them to drag him
at the tail of the cart, else he would have been left
far behind; but yet those brave fellows had not a
word, perhaps not a thought, concerning their own
labor or peril.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half-way to Skinner&rsquo;s Point!&rdquo; Joe Cushing
shouted as they mounted a hill of brown rock from
which the snow had been driven, and stood for a
single instant to regain their breath. &ldquo;Half-way to
Skinner&rsquo;s Point, and no signal from Sam! Who
can see the schooner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every eye had been directed seaward when they
first gained the elevation, but it was as if the wind
drove the snow yet more compactly, and the oldest
surfman among them failed to see objects at a distance
of fifty feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help the men who are drifting on to the
coast this night!&rdquo; Keeper Downey muttered, and
then added in a cheery tone, &ldquo;Get on, boys! Get
on! You&rsquo;ll freeze if you stand loitering here, and
exercise is what all of us are most needing just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny shut his teeth tightly together when, from
the movement of the wagon he knew the men were
settling forward in the rope harness again, and determined
to so husband his strength during the
remainder of the journey that when they came to
the more difficult portions of the road he might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
able to lend some assistance, even though feeble,
rather than act the part of a drag on the load.</p>

<p>During fifteen minutes more the men pulled and
tugged, straining every muscle to drag the heavily
laden wagon over the difficult way, and then as if
by common consent another halt was made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should be seeing the schooner by this time,
unless she has succeeded in crawling off from the
land,&rdquo; Keeper Downey said, letting go his hold on
the cart as he advanced to the edge of the rocky
cliffs and looked out over the waters.</p>

<p>No more than five hundred yards in distance lay
between them and the dreaded Skinner&rsquo;s Point,
where so many vessels had met their doom, yet the
driving snow shut out all save immediate objects
from their view.</p>

<p>Nothing had been seen or heard from Sam Hardy,
and even the keeper began to believe that possibly
the danger had been averted from this particular
vessel.</p>

<p>Again Downey gave the word to push on; again
the men strained at the ropes and the handle-bar,
and again they were advancing on their mission of
mercy.</p>

<p>Now no one spoke; each man was too far spent
with toil to dare waste breath in cheering his comrades.</p>

<p>Then, and it seemed to Benny as if they had but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
just started on this last stage of the journey, a glow
was seen dead ahead through the bewildering maze
of dancing, whirling snow, and an exclamation of
sorrow burst from the lips of every one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has struck, boys, and now we&rsquo;re to work
for their lives!&rdquo; Keeper Downey shouted, his words
causing each member of the crew to leap forward
with renewed vigor, as if the knowledge of peril to
others had taken from him all sensation of weariness.</p>

<p>Benny understood from these words that the light
which had been seen was Sam&rsquo;s signal telling that
the schooner had struck the rocks, and what was
much like a fever came over him as he exerted all
his puny strength to forcing the wagon-load of life-saving
appliances on yet faster.</p>

<p>It was a race between the life savers and death,
and by no possibility could they have won had
Keeper Downey been so unwise as to push them to
their utmost speed when first setting out from the
station. Now that the supreme struggle was at
hand they had a reserve of strength which bore
them on to partial victory.</p>

<p>Just how they finally succeeded in gaining the
point where Sam Hardy stood peering intently out
over the waste of boiling waters, Benny never knew.
The last five minutes of that mad scramble was to
him as a dream, in which he was conscious only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
making every effort to press forward, lest by faltering
he should be deemed unworthy a place among
those whom he considered true heroes. He knew,
however, that they were come to the spot where the
work could be performed, because of hearing Tom
Downey cry sharply as each man dropped the harness
of rope to run back to the wagon and take up
his proper station:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand aside, lad, and make it your business to
keep out of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny understood that there was nothing for him
to do in the way of lending aid, and realized he
could only show that he might be of some service in
the future by following the instructions to the letter.</p>

<p>Now had come the moment when the lad could
appreciate the value of the drilling which the men
were forced to undergo day after day.</p>

<p>Every member of the crew knew exactly what he
should do, and did it as methodically and quickly
as if on the drill-ground back of the station.</p>

<p>While the captain slung the haversack containing
the ammunition over his shoulders, Sam threw the
buoy off the cart. Henderson, Jones, and Brown
unloaded the shovel, pick, and sand-anchor, and
proceeded at once to fasten the latter at a point
already decided upon by Mr. Downey. Cushing
and Robbins took out the shot-line box. The captain
and Hardy placed the cannon a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
to the windward of the wagon, and the box was set
down on a line with the muzzle of the gun.</p>

<p>The keeper loaded with cartridges, Hardy brought
the shot, which he held for the captain to wipe, and
then inserted it into the bore of the gun, forcing it
down firmly on the charge. Joe Cushing wet a
fathom of the shot-line and bent it into the shank
of the shot with three half-hitches, without disturbing
the fakes, and without leaving any slack line
between the gun and the shot-line box.</p>

<p>Hardy and Cushing, kneeling either side of the
cannon, trained the muzzle to the right or the left
as Downey commanded. While this was being done
Sawyer unloaded and carried the crotch (two pieces
of wood formed after the fashion of the letter X) to
a point near the shore, in a line between the sand
anchor and the wreck.</p>

<p>Even Benny, who knew nothing of such labor,
understood that many seconds of valuable time must
have been saved by the crew being so familiar with
all the details of the work, and accustomed to performing
each portion of it in like manner every
time.</p>

<p>A description of the men at work is given at this
moment in order that one may know exactly how a
life-saving crew goes to work, and it must not be
supposed that Keeper Downey&rsquo;s men, or even Benny
Foster, directed their gaze all the time toward these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
operations, without glancing seaward where was the
noble vessel grinding her life out upon the cruel
rocks, as her crew looked down into the face of
what would have been certain death but for the
presence of those brave fellows on the bluff.</p>

<p>When the men halted with the wagon, and even
while they were removing the implements, every one
could see the schooner as she lay not more than a
hundred and fifty yards from the shore, heading
directly toward them.</p>

<p>So large was she, and with her sails holding back,
as it were, much of the snow, even Benny could
distinguish her quite distinctly, and while his comrades
labored as do men who work in defence of
their lives, he saw portions of rail and deck torn off
piece-meal by the waves which were striking sledge-hammer
blows against the side of the doomed craft,
each one sounding, even above the howling of the
blasts, like the booming of a cannon.</p>

<p>Seven men could be made out now and then when
the snow wreaths were less dense, in various places
of refuge about the wreck; three were aloft in the
port mizzen-rigging, one in the port fore-rigging,
and three about the forecastle, or in the bowsprit.
In these positions they remained apparently immovable.
It was to Benny as if they were frozen beyond
the power of movement, as indeed might have been
the case, for the night was bitterly cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
So near the shore did the wreck lay that it seemed
impossible Downey could miss his aim.</p>

<p>Benny heard Joe Cushing say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With five ounces of powder and a No. 9 shot-line
bent on, there should be no trouble in opening
communication with those poor fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the keeper had adjusted the piece and
pulled the lanyard.</p>

<p>Benny saw a tongue of flame leap out from the
mouth of the gun, and as the shot sped through the
air, the line, so carefully laid in the faking-box, uncoiled
length by length, until suddenly and without
apparent cause it parted.</p>

<p>The shot sped on; but fully two thirds of the line
remained in the box.</p>

<p>In the shortest possible space of time, and without
unnecessary words, the cannon was reloaded with
the same amount of powder and the same-sized line
as before.</p>

<p>Once more appeared the tongue of flame. In the
midst of it the lad, who hardly breathed because of
his excitement, saw the missile as it sped onward
true to its aim, dragging after it length upon length
of thin line which unloosed from the box in the most
perfect fashion, and then a loud cry of triumph went
up from the brave fellows who had expended so
much labor to aid the unfortunate mariners.</p>

<p>Even in the gloom and amid the falling snow one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
could see that narrow, black thread as it lay fairly
across the wreck just forward of the mizzen-rigging,
and within easy reach of the sailors in the vicinity;
but yet no one of that imperiled crew left his place
of refuge to seize upon it.</p>

<p>Just for an instant the life savers on the shore
stood in amazement. They had laid to hand a
means of escape, and yet those who were so near
death had not moved a finger toward availing themselves
of the opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are most likely frozen into helplessness,&rdquo;
Keeper Downey cried. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them one more
line, boys, and this time we&rsquo;ll send it farther forward.
There must be some one on that schooner
who can help himself, as least so far as to haul in
the rope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rapidly as the life savers worked before, they
moved yet more quickly now that it was understood
those whom they would rescue were so nearly unable
to aid themselves.</p>

<p>It seemed to Benny as if he had no more than
time to count ten before the third faking-box had
been brought from the wagon, and the gun was reloaded,
re-aimed, and discharged.</p>

<p>Again he saw the narrow black line amid the
white, drifting snow. Again a cry of triumph went
up from those whom he called his comrades, and
this time the line lay directly across the deck of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
schooner just abaft the fore-rigging, where the sailor
on the port side might reach it without so much as
leaving his station.</p>

<p>After five seconds, perhaps, this man, whose garments
had almost been brushed by the line-carrying
shot, made no motion, and then slowly, as if it required
all his strength to move so much as a finger,
the unfortunate sailor stretched forth his hand until
he grasped that narrow cord which alone remained
between him and death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t haul it in!&rdquo; Sam Hardy cried in dismay.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than he can do to raise his arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the crew of the schooner could not second the
efforts of the life savers, then indeed were they not
rescued, for no man might get through that surf
from the shore to the schooner, and the life-boat
could not be used because of shallow water and
rocks.</p>

<p>Every man on the bluff shouted words of encouragement
which could not be heard by those for
whom they were intended; but it seemed impossible
to remain quiet while the half-dead sailors
stood within reach of help, and yet were unable to
grasp it.</p>

<p>It was to Benny as if a full hour passed, although
in fact perhaps not more than three or four minutes
elapsed before the man in the fore-rigging succeeded
in thrashing his arms together, most likely to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the ice which, forming over his garments, encased
him as if in bonds of iron, and then, slowly at first,
but more rapidly as the seconds passed, he succeeded
in recovering the use of his limbs until he reached
down and caught up the line.</p>

<p>Now it was a shout of triumph which went up
from those on the bluff, and the anxious lad who
was bending forward over the very edge of the rocks
believed the sailor heard the cry, for it was as if
something suddenly animated him. He began
hauling in on this means of escape from the angry
waters as he turned his head toward those in the
mizzen-rigging, evidently urging them to come to
his assistance.</p>

<p>Each instant was fraught with danger for those
upon the wreck. Plank by plank the schooner was
being torn to pieces by the irresistible force of the
towering waves, and it needed not that one should
be versed in such matters to understand that before
many moments passed one or all of the spars must
go by the board.</p>

<p>Now that the sailor on the wreck was hauling in
the shot-line, the crew set about making the necessary
arrangements for sending aboard the hawser,
and before this had been completed Benny shouted,
although speaking to no one in particular:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men in the mizzen-rigging are coming
down! They are going to help themselves!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as the lad had said, for soon all save two
on the forecastle were hauling on the tackle which
was made fast to the shot-line, and in perhaps ten
minutes from the time the last missile was fired
across the deck of the wreck, the sailors had succeeded
in attaching the tail-block to the mainmast.</p>

<p>Now even Benny could be of assistance in manning
the whip to haul the breeches-buoy out to the
ship.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;"><img id="ip_110" src="images/i118.jpg" width="315" height="213" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>As the lad saw the buoy appearing and disappearing
amid the waves, but continuing rapidly on toward
the wreck, a great joy came into his heart, and
he realized then, if never before, the wondrous
pleasure which must come to those who succeed in
saving lives after a desperate battle.</p>

<p>When the buoy reached the wreck those ashore
saw a man step into it, and then came the command:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the lee whip! Haul ashore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the life savers were working to economize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
time. Every second must be utilized if that crew
of seven was to be brought ashore before the
schooner should have been torn to pieces.</p>

<p>Anxious though Benny was, and fearful lest they
should not succeed in getting even one ashore, the
breeches-buoy appeared to be moving swiftly, as
indeed was the case, for every man of the crew,
tailing on the whip, was working as only men can
under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>The first of the rescued was well-nigh helpless
after gaining the shore, and now had come the time
when Benny might be of some assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take care of him, sir, and it will save a
man&rsquo;s labor when you need all hands at the whip,&rdquo;
the lad said as Keeper Downey approached, and the
latter replied with a ring of cheeriness in his tones
which had not been heard since the work began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll come in handy, lad.
Roust that fellow about; don&rsquo;t let him remain
quiet, for he must keep the blood circulating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the weather whip was manned, and the buoy
forced out toward the wreck to receive another passenger.
In again was it hauled, and two lives had
been saved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the weather whip! Haul out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third had taken his place in the breeches-buoy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the lee whip! Haul ashore!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third had been saved.</p>

<p>And so went on the work while the tempest
howled and raged; the snow wreathed and whirled
as if to blind the life savers, and the sea roared and
bellowed at losing its prey; but in time&mdash;in a comparatively
short time&mdash;six were ashore, and only
one remained upon the quivering vessel which was
now hardly more than a hulk, so sadly had the sea
battered and torn it.</p>

<p>For the last time the buoy was being run out, and
more than half the distance had been traversed when
suddenly, and without warning, the mizzen-mast
went by the board, carrying with it the mainmast.</p>

<p>As the second spar fell, communication between
the life savers and this poor fellow for whom they
were battling, was broken; but almost while the
disaster was taking place Tom Downey had sprung
to the gun for the purpose of sending out another
shot-line, when a cry of horror went up&mdash;a crash
was heard even above the howling of the tempest,
and the foremast had fallen.</p>

<p>Now it was that Benny witnessed a scene of heroism
such as is seldom heard about, although often
performed&mdash;heroism that is displayed during the
winter&rsquo;s tempests on our rock-bound coasts, in the
presence of those who themselves are heroes.</p>

<p>When the last spar fell he who remained upon the
wreck was seen to leap from the port-rail beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the raffle of spars and cordage which dashed to and
fro alongside, and Sam Hardy cried with a tone of
admiration in his sturdy voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fellow has got grit, and will fight well for
his life! See him strike out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was swimming bravely in the icy waters,
and every member of the crew, who an instant before
despaired of being able to save him, now began
to hope that through his own exertions the task
might be accomplished.</p>

<p>The surf was dashing a hundred feet up the side
of the cliff, and the water &rsquo;twixt the schooner and
the shore so filled with wreckage that it seemed as
if the swimmer must be torn to pieces ere he could
take a dozen strokes, but yet now and then, as the
billows raised him on high, it could be seen that he
was holding his own&mdash;that he was making headway
toward the shore.</p>

<p>It needed no word of command from Tom Downey
to send every member of his crew into the
foaming waters, and there, with a line stretched
from one to the other, the entire seven formed a
chain; with Sam Hardy at the outermost end, all
buried under each succeeding wave, but yet pressing
outward in the hope of being able to clutch the
gallant swimmer before he should become exhausted.</p>

<p>Finally it seemed as if the man had gained a foothold
on the rocks, for he apparently stood in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
water knee-deep one single instant, and then a receding
sea, lifting him from his footing, hurled him
backward toward the hulk from which he had
escaped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me more rope!&rdquo; Sam Hardy shouted, and
Benny stifled the cry of fear which came to his lips
as he saw the gallant surfman swimming out to meet
the half-drowned sailor.</p>

<p>Then an incoming sea caught up the man who
had made such a desperate struggle for life, bore
him shoreward again until he was within twenty
feet of Hardy, when one of the schooner&rsquo;s spars,
rearing up in the water as if raised by some giant
hand, descended upon the struggling wretch, crushing
out his life as it forced him down to the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">FLUFF A HERO.</span></h2>

<p>During the work of rescue Benny was fully employed,
according to instructions received from
Keeper Downey, in ministering to those who had
been brought on shore.</p>

<p>The clothing of the men was water-soaked, as a
matter of course, and very shortly after gaining the
shore these saturated garments were frozen stiff.
Therefore it was necessary that the rescued be kept
moving to and fro as rapidly as possible, and when
one or another, exhausted by previous exposure,
would have succumbed to the drowsiness which precedes
death by freezing, Benny urged him to walk
about, employing threats when entreaties were of
no avail.</p>

<p>Immediately after the brave sailor had met his
death Keeper Downey called sharply for Benny,
and when the lad stood before him, asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to make another try at finding
the station, lad?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rescued men should be able to get there
under your guidance more quickly than by remaining
with us. If you can keep your wits in this
smother of snow, set out, and see to it that every
man moves at his best pace. The fog-horn will give
you the direction. Once you have arrived oblige the
men to strip off their frozen garments, and supply
them with dry clothing. I am trusting you to take
all six of them in, Benny, and it isn&rsquo;t impossible
one or more, half-dazed as they are, may refuse to
move as rapidly as is necessary, therefore you must
keep a sharp lookout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I go now, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be off as quickly as you can,&rdquo; Tom Downey
replied, and Benny noted with pride that the keeper
turned immediately away to attend to the reloading
of the beach-wagon, a fact which, to the lad&rsquo;s mind,
proved that he was trusted implicitly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to come with me,&rdquo; Benny said, going
to where the rescued men were tramping round-about
in a circle, threshing their arms together to
keep up the circulation of blood. &ldquo;Mr. Downey
says you must be kept moving at full speed, and
since I&rsquo;m not big enough to carry out the orders if
there&rsquo;s any kick made, your captain ought to see
that there is no loitering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our captain was the last to leave the schooner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
and you know he did not gain the shore,&rdquo; one of
the men replied, his voice choking with emotion.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mate, however, and you&rsquo;ll find we can
obey orders. A man would be a poor stick who
didn&rsquo;t carry out any instructions given by those
who have met death more than half-way to save
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very certain of the road, but if we
follow the sound of the fog-horn we&rsquo;ll come out
near the station, and we&rsquo;d best get off now, else
Mr. Downey will think we&rsquo;re loafing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike out, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll keep at your heels,&rdquo; the
mate replied, and, trusting to this promise, Benny
set off, bending low to protect his face from the
pitiless lashing of the snow.</p>

<p>Very proud was the boy at having been given this
share in the labor of rescue, and when the way was
difficult, or the elements beat him back, he repeated
to himself again and again that if this duty should
be performed worthily he would most likely be entrusted
with others as occasion might arise.</p>

<p>The journey to the station was simply a repetition
of the one made after the schooner was first sighted,
except that on this occasion he had companionship,
and his mind was taken from the difficulties of the
way in a great measure by the responsibility which
had been put upon him.</p>

<p>The mate urged the crew to keep pace with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Benny, but every man among them found it more
difficult to press on than did the lad; yet the hinder-most
was no more than a dozen yards in the rear
when the guide gained the door of the station and
was welcomed by the shrill barking of Fluff, who
had distinguished his master&rsquo;s footsteps even above
the howling of the gale.</p>

<p>Since the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> sailed from Calcutta this was
the first time the tiny dog had been left alone, and
the welcome he gave Benny was so vigorous that it
seemed as if the noise would shake his tiny body
into fragments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be a good dog, Fluff, and wait just a little bit
till I get dry clothes for the men. I&rsquo;m just as glad
to see you as you are to see me, but while there&rsquo;s
work to be done we mustn&rsquo;t spend time telling each
other about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog danced and capered and barked at
Benny&rsquo;s heels as he went back and forth from the
store-room to where the sailors were gathered around
the glowing fire, and it was much as if he fancied
himself assisting in the labor&mdash;as if Fluff also
counted on being a surfman.</p>

<p>The cook, who had retired before the crew set out,
now came down to perform his regular share of the
work in such cases, which was to make a fresh
supply of coffee and prepare a meal for the exhausted
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Benny had faithfully carried out the instructions
given him by the keeper, and there was nothing
more he could do until the crew should return, when
he knew full well his services would be welcomed
gladly by the weary, half-frozen life savers.</p>

<p>The mate was disposed to indulge in conversation,
and after having drank a bowl of hot coffee, he told
the lad that the schooner which was being torn to
pieces on Skinner&rsquo;s Point was the <i class="ship">Three Brothers</i>,
coal-laden, from Philadelphia to Portland. At noon
on that day, so low did the temperature fall that ice
had formed about the craft until she was unmanageable,
and during five hours had been driven at the
mercy of wind and waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing the schooner was bound to go ashore,
we hoped it might be in the vicinity of where she
did strike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you want her wrecked there? It
seems to me a worse place couldn&rsquo;t be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We knew there was a life-saving station near,
and when the red glare of the Coston signal flashed
out through the snow, all hands understood that a
crew of good men and true stood ready to do whatsoever
lay in their power to give us aid. I answered
that signal, and then ran over in my mind the instructions
which the service sends out to every ship-master
and mate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of instructions?&rdquo; Benny asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
showing by the expression on his face that this
information was something entirely new to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you care to find out, you will find a small,
black, water-proofed book, something like a note-case,
in the pocket of the coat I took off, and there
everything is set down so plainly any sailor can
understand what should be done when the life-saving
crew appears. But you here in the station should
know all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been here but a day or two,&rdquo; Benny
replied gravely. &ldquo;I was on the ship <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>
when she went ashore only a short distance from
this building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you know what it is to see these men
come to your assistance. How many were saved
from the ship, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one but me,&rdquo; Benny replied, turning away
quickly lest the mate should see the tears in his
eyes, and in order to avoid further questioning he
went in search of the book mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing in my pocket, lad,&rdquo; the
mate cried, understanding, perhaps, why Benny
professed such eagerness to see the instructions.
&ldquo;I took it from my berth when it seemed certain
the <i class="ship">Three Brothers</i> was doomed. Give me the
book, and I&rsquo;ll read that part of the printed matter
which most interests us sailors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After searching over the sodden clothing, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
had carefully hung on pegs behind the stove, Benny
found a tiny book and brought it to the mate, who
read as one does who wishes to refresh his memory:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The patrolman, after discovering your vessel
ashore and burning a Coston signal, hastens to his
station for assistance. If the use of a boat is practicable,
either the large life-boat is launched from
its ways in the station and proceeds to the wreck by
water, or the lighter surf-boat is hauled overland
to a point opposite the wreck and launched, as circumstances
may require.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Upon the boat reaching your vessel, the directions
and orders of the keeper (who always commands
and steers the boat) should be implicitly
obeyed. Any headlong rushing and crowding
should be prevented, and the captain of the vessel
should remain on board, to preserve order, until
every other person has left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Women, children, helpless persons, and passengers
should be passed into the boat first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Goods or baggage will positively not be taken
into the boat until all are landed. If any be passed
in against the keeper&rsquo;s remonstrance he is fully
authorized to throw the same overboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Should it be inexpedient to use either the life-boat
or surf-boat, recourse will be had to the wreck-gun
and beach-apparatus for the rescue by the
breeches-buoy or the life-car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;A shot with a small line attached will be fired
across your vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get hold of the line as soon as possible and
haul on board until you get a tail-block with a whip
or endless line rove through it. This tail-block
should be hauled on board as quickly as possible to
prevent the whip drifting off with the set, or fouling
with wreckage, etc. Therefore, if you have
been driven into the rigging, where but one or two
men can work to advantage, cut the shot-line and
run it through some available block, such as the
throat or peak-halliards block, or any block which
will afford a clear lead, or even between the ratlines,
that as many as possible may assist in the hauling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Attached to the tail-block will be a tally-board
with the following directions in English on one side
and French on the other:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Make the tail of the block fast to the lower
mast, well up. If the masts are gone, then to the
best place you can find. Cast off the shot-line, see
that the rope in the block runs free, and show a
signal to the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As soon as your signal is seen a three-inch
hawser will be bent on to the whip and hauled off
to your ship by the life-saving crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If the circumstances will admit, you can assist
the life-saving crew by manning that part of the whip
to which the hawser is bent, and hauling with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;When the end of the hawser is got on board a
tally-board will be found attached, bearing the following
directions in English on one side and French
on the other:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Make this hawser fast about two feet above
the tail-block, see all clear and that the rope in the
block runs free, and show a signal to the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take particular care that there are no turns of
the whip-line around the hawser. To prevent this
take the end of the hawser up between the parts of
the whip before making it fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the hawser is made fast, the whip cast
off from the hawser, and your signal seen by the
life-saving crew, they will haul the hawser taut and
by means of the whip will haul off to your ship a
breeches-buoy suspended from a traveller-block, or
a life-car from rings, running on the hawser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If the breeches-buoy be sent, let one man immediately
get into it, thrusting his legs through the
breeches. If the life-car, remove the hatch, place
as many persons into it as it will hold, and secure
the hatch on the outside by the hatch-bar and hook,
signal as before, and the buoy or car will be hauled
ashore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In many instances two men can be landed in
the breeches-buoy at the same time by each putting
a leg through a leg of the breeches and holding on
to the lifts of the buoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Children, when brought ashore by the buoy,
should be in the arms of older persons, or securely
lashed to the buoy. Women and children should
be landed first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Circumstances may arise, owing to the strength
of the current or set, or the danger of the wreck
breaking up immediately, when it would be impossible
to send off the hawser. In such case a breeches-buoy
or life-car will be hauled off instead by the
whip, or sent off to you by the shot-line, and you
will be hauled ashore through the surf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If your vessel is stranded during the night and
discovered by the patrolman, which you will know
by his burning a brilliant red light, keep a bright
lookout for signs of the arrival of the life-saving
crew abreast your vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From one to four hours may intervene between
the burning of the light and their arrival, as the
patrolman will have to return to his station, perhaps
three or four miles distant, and the life-saving crew
draw the apparatus or surf-boat through the sand or
over bad roads to where your vessel is stranded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lights on the beach will indicate their arrival,
and the sound of cannon-firing from the shore may
be taken as evidence that a line has been fired across
your vessel. Therefore, upon hearing the cannon,
make strict search aloft, fore, and aft, for the shot-line,
for it is almost certain to be there. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the movements of the life-saving crew may not be
perceptible to you, owing to the darkness, your ship
will be a good mark for the men experienced in the
use of the wreck-gun, and the first shot seldom
fails.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mate had read thus far, Benny listening intently
to every word, when the sound of voices outside,
and the opening of the boat-room door, told
that the crew had returned.</p>

<p>Fluff greeted the men with his shrill barking, and
Benny laid out dry clothing for each one, an attention
which was fully appreciated, as could be told
by the exclamations of satisfaction and of pleasure
uttered by the weary crew as they entered the mess-room.</p>

<p>The shipwrecked men greeted their rescuers with
the liveliest protestations of gratitude, and Tom
Downey replied, even while Benny was pounding
his coat with a broomstick in order to so break the
ice that the keeper could take it off:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only done what the Government hires
us for, mates, an&rsquo; our extra pay comes in when
we&rsquo;re able to save lives, as in this case. I&rsquo;d feel
that the night was more of a success if we hadn&rsquo;t
lost a life; but we ashore couldn&rsquo;t say how weak
the spars had grown under the pounding of the
waves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the first line came aboard I thought we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
were doomed because it would be impossible to help
ourselves,&rdquo; the mate replied. &ldquo;For a time it
seemed as if my arms were frozen stiff, and but for
the knowledge that death would come in a very few
moments unless something could be done to second
your efforts, I believe of a verity I should have died
where I stood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the sailors began relating their personal experiences,
and soon the rescuers were before the
glowing fire while the cook and Benny passed around
coffee or food, with Fluff sitting bolt upright apparently
listening intently to every word.</p>

<p>The two whose duty it was to go on patrol could
not be excused, however excessive the labor just
performed. The storm was still raging furiously,
and the <i class="ship">Three Brothers</i> might not be the only craft
in peril on the coast that night.</p>

<p>Robbins and Sawyer remained in the cheery mess-room
no longer than was absolutely necessary, and
then they went out into the howling storm to walk
the long beats on which might be found more work
for the crew which had already done such brave duty.</p>

<p>Keeper Downey ordered Benny to bed, accompanying
the command with words that gave the lad
most sincere pleasure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done as good work, accordin&rsquo; to your
experience, as any man among us, Benjamin, an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;re proud of you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam Hardy nodded his approval of this praise,
and Benny, with Fluff C. Foster in his arms, went
up-stairs to bed feeling that he would be willing to
brave almost any danger in order to earn another
compliment equal to that.</p>

<p>When the amateur surfman awakened next morning
the sun was shining brightly, and, save for the
roaring of the surf, nothing told of the furious
tempest which had so lately raged.</p>

<p>The cook had already gone down-stairs, and Benny
dressed himself hurriedly, for he was not pleased at
the prospect of being late at his post of duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I counted on your waking Fluff and me,&rdquo; he
said reproachfully as he entered the kitchen. &ldquo;We
were up so late&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly the reason why I sneaked down-stairs
on the quiet. After last night&rsquo;s work you
should have had a long nap, instead of being down
here before the fire is fairly going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do enough to hurt us,&rdquo; Benny replied
with a laugh, &ldquo;and surely we must be needed
this morning, when there are so many mouths to
feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a bigger family than this many a time,
an&rsquo; got through with the work alone, but since
you&rsquo;ve been so foolish as to turn out, I&rsquo;ll be glad
of your help, for a handy lad like you makes the job
a light one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if I was getting praised all around,&rdquo;
Benny said with a laugh as he made his toilet.
&ldquo;Pretty soon you&rsquo;ll be finding out that I don&rsquo;t
deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, lad, for all hands of us are getting
a good bit of satisfaction out of you and the
dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was kept busy in the kitchen a greater
portion of the succeeding forty-eight hours, and
then the shipwrecked sailors were sent to the neighboring
city, after which the crew at the station
settled down to the old routine of drill and patrol,
every man looking forward eagerly to the reply from
headquarters regarding their request in the boy&rsquo;s
behalf.</p>

<p>Sam Hardy and Joe Cushing had taken it upon
themselves to teach Maje that Fluff was entitled to
the liberty of the station grounds, and, at the expense
of considerable time, and much loss of temper
on the part of Maje, the lesson was so nearly learned
that the big dog allowed the little one to go here
and there without interference, but Benny did not
trust wholly to appearances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any harm if I keep my eye on Fluff
when he goes out,&rdquo; the lad said gravely after Sam
Hardy had suggested that there was no longer any
good reason for being suspicious of Maje. &ldquo;Of
course your dog is bound to be jealous for a spell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and till he gets over it I wouldn&rsquo;t want to trust
Fluff alone with him very long at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Sam and Joe were positive Maje could be
depended upon to behave himself, and appeared
eager Benny should allow matters to take their
natural course, so far as the two animals were concerned,
therefore the boy permitted Fluff to go out
of doors whenever he was so disposed; but he was
careful to first make certain that Maje was not in
the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset on the day the shipwrecked
mariners had been conveyed to the city. There
was not a cloud in the sky, and the sea was so calm
that it was almost difficult to believe it could ever
be aroused to a roaring fury.</p>

<p>The lookout on day-duty had come down to the
station for supper, and the two whose time for
patrol began at sunset were already eating the evening
meal that they might be ready to set out at the
exact moment.</p>

<p>Benny had been assisting the cook as usual, but
was now waiting upon the men who were about to
go on patrol.</p>

<p>Fluff, ten minutes previous, had whined for permission
to go out of doors for a stroll, and, after
learning that Maje was in the oil-room, where he
usually found a shelter during exceedingly cold or
stormy weather, Benny opened the door for his pet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
So white was Fluff, thanks to his master&rsquo;s custom
of giving him a bath every other day, that it was
almost impossible to distinguish him in the gloom
of early twilight while he remained on the snow, and
Benny lost sight of him before he had gone a hundred
feet from the building.</p>

<p>Then he was called by one of the men, and while
attending to whatever trifling duty had been set
him, it was observed that the boy appeared anxious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Benjamin?&rdquo; Sam Hardy
asked. &ldquo;Anything wrong with Mr. Fluff C.
Foster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, sir; but he disappeared so soon
after leaving the house that I&rsquo;m wondering if he
didn&rsquo;t get into the oil-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon not, else we&rsquo;d heard something from
Maje before this. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out, though, an&rsquo; will
look after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam opened the door as he spoke, and at that
instant Fluff could be heard in the distance, barking
shrilly.</p>

<p>Benny leaped to his feet and ran toward the
door, calling the dog by name.</p>

<p>From the noise it could be told that Fluff came
nearer the building in obedience to the summons,
and then stopped, yelping and barking as if in dire
distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, sir! Come this minute!&rdquo; Benny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
cried peremptorily, and to the surprise of all, for the
dog usually obeyed readily, the yelping increased
as Fluff retreated from the house.</p>

<p>Benny ran after him, and Sam Hardy followed
quickly, as if he believed something serious was the
cause of the animal&rsquo;s disobedience.</p>

<p>The remainder of the crew stood near the open
door curiously, and after a brief interval they heard
Benny calling yet more peremptorily to the dog,
when for reply the yelping was changed to most
dismal howls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maje shall have a sound flogging if he has dared
to touch that little fellow!&rdquo; Keeper Downey said
threateningly as he took up his cap to leave the building,
and just at that instant the crew were startled
by hearing Sam Hardy shout:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man overboard! Out with the surf-boat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Members of a life-saving crew never stop to question
a statement of such a nature as that made by
their comrade.</p>

<p>Every man sprang to the boat-room door, and the
surf-boat was outside the building ready for launching
by the time Sam came up, breathless with rapid
running, but not excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond the Horseshoe!&rdquo; he cried, taking his
proper station with the others, and in what to a
stranger would have seemed an incredibly short
space of time the light craft was in the water, leaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
from wave to wave under the impetus given by
three pairs of oars.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Horseshoe&rdquo; was a circular reef which made
out from the main shore five or six hundred yards
from the station, and the cook ran with all speed
across the bluff, with the idea that he might arrive
there in advance of the boat.</p>

<p>His legs were no match for the life savers&rsquo; arms,
however, and when he gained the cliff which overlooked
the reef the crew were dragging the body of
a man over the surf-boat&rsquo;s rail, while a light gunning-skiff,
overturned, a short distance away, was sufficient
evidence as to the cause of the disaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some greenhorn out here alone, sneaking along
the shore hoping to bag a few ducks just at sunset,
has come near paying dearly for the sport,&rdquo; the
cook muttered in an angry tone. &ldquo;After two or
three more accidents of the same kind, sportsmen
from the city will begin to understand, I hope, that
such fun is dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the third mishap of a similar nature that
season, and in one case the venturesome hunter had
lost his life, therefore the cook might well be excused
for losing his temper over such carelessness.</p>

<p>When he returned to the station the half-drowned
man had been carried into the building, but he still
retained sufficient consciousness to understand how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
his rescue had been brought about, and the cook
heard him say to Tom Downey:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for your toy dog I should
have drowned, for I&rsquo;d swallowed so much salt water
that it was impossible to make a very loud noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I reckon you can set it down as a fact that
Fluff C. Foster saved your life, mister, and from this
out he, as well as his master, is a member of this
&rsquo;ere crew if I can bring it about!&rdquo; Joe Cushing said
emphatically, as he emptied fully half the contents
of the sugar-bowl into a saucer and gave it to Fluff,
who was dancing to and fro, wagging his white tail
furiously, as if calling attention to the fact that
even a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; dog might be of some service in the
world.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">OFFICIAL PERMISSION.</span></h2>

<p>The story told by the stranger did not differ materially
from that which the cook had imagined after
seeing the overturned gunning-skiff.</p>

<p>The young gentleman, Francis P. Bradford by
name, had been paddling around the shore, keeping
well within the shadow of the rocks in the hope of
getting a good bag of wild ducks when they settled
upon the water at sunset. He had begun the voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
from a point two miles or more distant, and approached
in such manner that the men who were on
watch could not have seen him.</p>

<p>The shallow skiff, which Sam Hardy declared very
emphatically &ldquo;was little better than an egg-shell,&rdquo;
had run upon a submerged rock, and, the swell
arising at that instant, overset her, throwing the
sportsman into the water.</p>

<p>Encumbered as he was by heavy clothing, and
being by no means a skilful swimmer, the sportsman
could do no more than keep himself afloat,
while the boat was driven by the wind farther and
farther from the shore.</p>

<p>Knowing that a life-saving station was near at
hand, he shouted for help; but, as has been said, it
was impossible to make any very loud outcry, and,
rapidly becoming exhausted, he believed death was
inevitable until there suddenly appeared on the
bluff, to use his own words, &ldquo;what looked to be a
ball of white cotton blown along by the wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no idea it was a dog,&rdquo; he said continuing
the story, &ldquo;until the fluffy object straightened itself
out and began barking shrilly. I am certain the
little fellow understood my plight, for when some
person called him he ran back a few paces, and then
returned yelping and howling until one would have
said there was danger the volume of sound would
cause him to explode like an overcharged boiler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with delight as young
Bradford continued to praise Fluff; but an expression
of dissatisfaction came over his face when the
sportsman declared his intention of leaving with
Keeper Downey a sum of money to be expended
in purchasing food and dainties for the animal that
had been the means of saving his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Benny?&rdquo; Sam asked,
noting the look on the boy&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do at all, sir,&rdquo; and Benny spoke very
decidedly. &ldquo;Fluff wouldn&rsquo;t like to be paid for such
a thing as that, I&rsquo;m certain, and besides, if, as Mr.
Cushing says, he is a member of the crew, then it&rsquo;s
his business to save life if he can, without thinking
of taking money for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll guarantee that the idea of money never
came into Fluff C. Foster&rsquo;s head!&rdquo; Sam Hardy
cried, laughing heartily. &ldquo;You see, lad, what Mr.
Bradford proposes is to give the dog a reward, and
that any life-saver is entitled to if it be offered
voluntarily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would please me if the gentleman wouldn&rsquo;t
leave money for Fluff,&rdquo; Benny insisted. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t
seem right to take it for doing anything of the
kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that moment Mr. Bradford ceased to press
the matter; but later in the evening he had a long
conversation with Tom Downey, and those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
accidentally overheard scraps of the conversation
understood that the keeper was telling Benny&rsquo;s
pitiful story.</p>

<p>Fluff was not interested in anything which was
taking place around him. The feast of sugar which
Joe Cushing had set out was so tempting and so
delicious that he gave heed to nothing else.</p>

<p>When the sweet repast had come to an end, however,
the dog was petted by first one and then
another of the crew as he had never been before,
and Benny said laughingly, as he took the little fellow
in his arms fully half an hour before the usual
time for retiring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fluff will grow so proud that he&rsquo;ll be spoiled if
all hands praise him in this fashion. He&rsquo;d better
go to bed, and I&rsquo;ll make him understand that it
was no more than his duty to bark when he saw
Mr. Bradford in the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the boy and the dog disappeared for the
night, and after he had left the room the life savers
and their guest held a long consultation of a business
nature, which was to be kept a profound secret
from Benny and Fluff until all the details had been
carried into effect.</p>

<p>On the following morning immediately after breakfast,
Mr. Bradford left the station for the purpose of
hiring some one of the farmers nearby to carry him
into the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Very gravely he thanked Benny for the great service
which had been rendered him by Fluff, urging
the boy to promise that he would apply to him if at
any time in the future he should need assistance.</p>

<p>To this the lad agreed, and when the gentleman
had taken his departure said confidentially to Sam
Hardy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Fluff and I are to be surfmen we shan&rsquo;t be
obliged to beg from anyone, and I&rsquo;d a good deal
rather earn what we need than have it given us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, lad, it shall go your way, and I like the
idea you&rsquo;ve got in mind. Whether you and Fluff
will be able to cut much of a figure as surfmen is a
matter which needn&rsquo;t trouble us just now, for I&rsquo;ll
guarantee you don&rsquo;t come to want while this crew
holds together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny went about his regular duties as if nothing
out of the ordinary had occurred, and Fluff, believing
himself safe from any attack by Maje, ran to and
fro over the snow-covered rocks until his pink feet
were chilled by the frost, when he returned and,
standing before his master, held up first one and
then the other with a low whine which told of his
discomfort.</p>

<p>The cook placed a chair near the stove, and,
despite Benny&rsquo;s protestations, insisted that Fluff
should occupy it whenever he had been so foolish
as to stay out of doors until thoroughly chilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
&ldquo;You have no business to play on the rocks while
it is so cold,&rdquo; Benny said reprovingly, addressing
himself to the dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the nature of dogs and boys to be foolish
at times, Benny, and since they can&rsquo;t be expected
to have better sense we must do whatever we can to
repair the mischief. Therefore Fluff C. Foster sits
right there until he&rsquo;s comfortable once more.
There&rsquo;s nothing to be done around the kitchen for
the next two or three hours, and seein&rsquo; how you
and the dog are bent on being surfmen, now is the
chance to learn the duties of a crew when there&rsquo;s a
wreck off shore, as in the case of the <i class="ship">Three Brothers</i>.
Every man needs have in his head the man&oelig;uvres
to be performed at such a time, and it&rsquo;s all set down
here in the regulations under the head of &lsquo;Station
Bill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, sir?&rdquo; Benny asked
as he took the book from the cook&rsquo;s outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shows the station of each man after the
beach-wagon is on the shore ready for business.
You know that every member of the crew has a
number. Sam Hardy is 1; Joe Cushing, 2; Robbins,
3; Sawyer, 4, and so on. Here, under the same
numbers that the men answer to, is set down exactly
what must be done, with a few remarks to follow.
Now, since all that must be repeated at drill, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
would be a good idea if you stowed it away in your
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny began to read eagerly, understanding that
if he had been familiar with all this information
when the <i class="ship">Three Brothers</i> went ashore he possibly
might have been of more assistance, and until the
cook called him to assist in the work of preparing
dinner he read and re-read the following lines:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 1. Place gun in position; provide and load

<p>&ldquo;No. 7. Unload shovel and pick; assist to bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
sand-anchor; man the weather part of whip when
overhauling off the reel and sending off the hawser;
haul in slack of hawser; man fall, centre of crotch, and
am shifting man on the whip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The exercise must be considered as a whole, and
when a man has performed one duty he will proceed
to execute the next assigned him. All must work
together. While the captain, 1, and 2 are opening
communication with the gun and shot-line, 3, 4, 5,
and 6 will have the hawser and its connections ready
for sending off and hauling taut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When practising, as soon as the gun is discharged,
6 will go to the pole representing the wreck
and haul off and make fast the whip and hawser;
unless some other person willing to perform that
duty is present, 4 throws the buoy off the cart that
it may not interfere with removing the gun from the
cart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If through carelessness the shot-line has been
faked too tightly upon the pins, instead of forcing
it off the pins by the bottom board, which is liable
to split, raise the frame and remove a few of the
bottom fakes with the hand, when the remainder
will fall off into its place in the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sand-anchor must be opened, its sides at
right angles to each other, and buried upon its flat
in a narrow trench of sufficient depth, say two feet,
and the trench filled in solidly about the anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
&ldquo;In many instances, after communication is made
with the wreck, as many as two or three hundred
yards of shot-line will be left in the box. The captain
must be governed by circumstances as to the
best method of handling the surplus line. If there
is no danger of the wreck going to pieces, spare line
may be hauled on board the wreck, the shore end
being bent around the whip; but where great haste
is necessary it must be cut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bending the bight of the shot-line around the
whip is not recommended, as the portion inshore is
liable to foul the whip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cases may occur when, instead of unreeling the
whole whip from the reel, both parts of the whip
must be cut as soon as the whip-block is fast on
board the wreck. Keepers must act with promptness
in such cases, remembering that everything
must be sacrificed to save life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The point where the hawser is bent into the ship
must be as far as possible outside of where the ends
of the whip are bent together, in order that when
the hawser reaches the wreck the whip bend will be
well inshore, out of the reach of the shipwrecked
people, for should they, through excitement or
ignorance, cast that off instead of the hawser, communication
would be broken and much delay
result.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whip should be worked moderately slack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
unless extreme cold or drifting ice makes it necessary
that it should be kept out of the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instances may occur when the wreck is breaking
up rapidly, and there is not sufficient time to send
off the whip and hawser, or the crew are too much
exhausted to haul the gear off. In such cases, after
communication is made by means of the shot-line,
cut the shot-line, and bend the shore end onto a
single part of the whip; when the end of the whip
has reached the wreck, bend the bight of the whip
into the slings of the buoy (block removed), and let
the buoy be pulled off through the surf to the
wreck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was an apt pupil, and before nightfall could
repeat word for word more than one-half of the
Station Bill. It was his purpose to commit it all to
memory, but he was interrupted in the task late in
the afternoon by the return of Joe Cushing from the
post-office, and it was such a noisy home-coming
that every member of the crew knew what he
brought.</p>

<p>All save the lookout were in the building engaged
upon various trifling duties, when a series of yells
from the outside brought the men to their feet, and
Sam Hardy cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Joe Cushing! He&rsquo;s brought the mail,
and you can count for a certainty that in it is
the answer from headquarters in regard to Benny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Keeper Downey found it difficult to remain
calm, for that Sam had guessed correctly could be
told by the Indian yells to which Joe was giving
vent, and it is little wonder that the crew, instead
of waiting for his entrance, went to the door to meet
him, realizing as they did that in a few moments
would be known the views of the Superintendent
regarding the taking on of this new member.</p>

<p>Joe was coming at full speed, holding high above
his head the official-looking envelope, and, as if believing
his comrades had not been warned regarding
the importance of what he brought, he shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the answer from the Department! It
has been about as much as I could do to keep myself
from opening it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Downey stretched out his hand, and there
was just a shadow of anxiety to be seen on his face
as he took the missive.</p>

<p>The crew gathered around him; but Benny,
trembling with apprehension, stood a short distance
away holding Fluff in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it should be that we&rsquo;ve got to go away now
when things are fixed so nice, we&rsquo;d be awful sorry,
Fluffy; but we&rsquo;ll try not to let the crew know we&rsquo;re
feeling bad,&rdquo; he whispered to the dog while keeping
his eyes fixed upon Sam Hardy.</p>

<p>Tom Downey was too impatient to permit of his
reading carefully the communication from the Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of the Service. He first glanced quickly over
the letter, catching a word here and there, until
understanding the proposition, when he cried
joyously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, boys! Benny&rsquo;s entitled to stay
here so long as we pay his bills!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew the Superintendent wasn&rsquo;t the kind of
a man that would turn a cold shoulder on a lad like
him,&rdquo; Sam Hardy said approvingly; and patting
Benny on the head, he added, &ldquo;Now, lad, you&rsquo;re
regularly one of us, seein&rsquo; how you&rsquo;re here by
authority, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll venture to say that before spring
comes you&rsquo;ll have the drill at your tongue and
fingers&rsquo; ends with the best of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny, burying his face in Fluff&rsquo;s silken hair,
whispered to the dog:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re awful lucky, Fluff, and we&rsquo;ll make sure
the crew won&rsquo;t feel sorry because of helping us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t crying when good news has come, are
you, lad?&rdquo; Sam asked, raising the boy&rsquo;s chin until
he could look into his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m not, Mr. Hardy. I just wanted to
remind Fluff so he&rsquo;d never forget it, that we was
bound to work mighty hard to pay all hands of you
for being so good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon that part of it will be all right, my son.
We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; full value for all we give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That which added to Benny&rsquo;s pleasure was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
fact that from the keeper to the cook, every member
of the crew exhibited the liveliest joy because
he was allowed to remain at the station, and an
evening never to be forgotten by the lad was this
which followed the receipt of the letter from headquarters.</p>

<p>Half a dozen times over was Tom Downey called
upon to read the communication from their Chief,
and if it be true that a person&rsquo;s right ear tingles
when good is spoken of them, the Superintendent
of the Life-Saving Service must have been surprised
because of the warmth of that organ.</p>

<p>Even amid the general rejoicing Benny found
opportunity to study the <i class="cite">Regulations</i> and observing
him at this work Sam Hardy proposed that
Keeper Downey write an additional paragraph to
the Station Bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benny must have a regular duty, and we&rsquo;ll call
him No. 8. Set down exactly what part he is to
play, an&rsquo; let him learn it with the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night when Benny, with Fluff in his arms,
stood on the threshold to bid his kindly guardians a
&ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; all hands replied in concert:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, No. 8.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means Fluff as well as me,&rdquo; Benny cried
with a laugh, and as he laid down to sleep that night
&ldquo;No. 8&rdquo; was an exceedingly happy boy.</p>

<p>On the following morning Benny had a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
proposition to make Sam Hardy, and after his portion
of the morning&rsquo;s work had been done he called
the surfman aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to ask a favor of you, Mr. Hardy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, lad, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands call me No. 8, so that proves I&rsquo;m
regularly one of the crew, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it does, Benny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I should have some regular work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have, my lad. You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; as much
now as the cook, an&rsquo; some of the boys are beginnin&rsquo;
to think you can take his place next season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My work in the kitchen don&rsquo;t count. It&rsquo;s only
enough to take up the spare time. What I mean
is, I ought to have a share in all that the crew
does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you drivin&rsquo; at, Benny? Suppose you
talk it right out plain, an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll understand the
quicker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this, Mr. Hardy: I want to go on patrol
duty with you every night, no matter what time you
start out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Benny, there are some nights
when that&rsquo;s precious hard work, and almost any
time in the winter it&rsquo;s no joke to turn out, say
about midnight, an&rsquo; walk this blooming shore four
hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, sir; but yet it will toughen me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
do it, and after a spell I won&rsquo;t mind it any more&rsquo;n
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s your idea in doin&rsquo; such work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to grow into so much of a surfman that
I can see at night the same as you do. When the
<i class="ship">Three Brothers</i> was sighted I couldn&rsquo;t make her out
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s trainin&rsquo; your eyes you&rsquo;re after, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, perhaps that&rsquo;s what you could call it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll talk with Downey, and see what he
thinks of the scheme, although I&rsquo;m willing to say
right up an&rsquo; down now that I don&rsquo;t just like it. The
job is too rough for a little chap like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get hardened to bad weather, and the
cold, and all that sort of thing if I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stay
in the life-saving service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam turned away with a laugh, and not until
evening did he make any reply to the request.</p>

<p>Then, when the hour was near at hand for him to
go on patrol, he said, speaking to all hands, including
Fluff&rsquo;s master:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benny claims the right to do patrol duty, if he&rsquo;s
No. 8 in this &rsquo;ere crew, an&rsquo; the keeper has given permission
for him to act as my apprentice, exceptin&rsquo;
when the weather is too rough. Therefore, Mr.
Benjamin H. Foster, you&rsquo;ll make ready for a four
hours&rsquo; turn, and the thermometer is standin&rsquo; well
down to zero. If this night&rsquo;s work don&rsquo;t give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
a different idea of what it&rsquo;s fitting a lad should do;
then I&rsquo;ll say there&rsquo;ll be no use in our tryin&rsquo; to keep
you out of the Service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Benny suffered from the cold during this four
hours&rsquo; tramp, Sam Hardy was none the wiser regarding
it, for he held the pace regardless of rough
ways or banks of snow, plodding sturdily by the
surfman&rsquo;s side throughout the entire time. But it
was observed by Sam Hardy that on their return to
the station he went immediately to bed, and next
morning, in relating the experiences of the previous
night to the keeper privately, Sam added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all grit, that lad is, an&rsquo; when he&rsquo;s older
grown I allow he&rsquo;ll be an ornament to this &rsquo;ere
station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cook declared, after dinner had been eaten
and the apartments set to rights, that it was necessary
for Keeper Downey to issue a positive order
preventing No. 8 from doing more than his share of
the work, and Benny, his face crimsoning with
pleasure, would have turned the conversation into
some other channel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say,&rdquo; the cook added emphatically.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be a regular Kitchen Station
Bill made out for you, else before many days I&rsquo;ll
find myself idle. So let it be understood, No. 8,
that you&rsquo;re only to do so much of the work as belongs
to your part, and in the future you and Fluff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
C. Foster will have longer loafin&rsquo; spells. If you
study the <i class="cite">Regulations</i> after dark, I reckon it will be
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Downey had begun questioning the cook as
to what share of the work Benny really did, when
the noise of bells was heard outside, and a moment
later came a knock at the door followed almost immediately
by the entrance of Mr. Bradford&mdash;he
whom, as the crew claimed, Fluff had rescued from
drowning.</p>

<p>He greeted the men cheerily; had a kindly word
for Benny; but took Fluff in his arms petting him
affectionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with leaving matters as they
were day before yesterday, so far as this little fellow
was concerned,&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to
Keeper Downey. &ldquo;But for the dog I should have
been drowned, and as Benny refused me the satisfaction
of repaying Fluff, I claim the right to bestow
upon him what the government would award either
of you for a timely rescue of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While speaking he had drawn from his pocket a
daintily fashioned silver collar to which was attached
a small gold token.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a medal of honor made from a coin, and
inscribed: &lsquo;To Fluff C. Foster for having saved the
life of Francis P. Bradford, January 2, 1894.&rsquo; That
much I am entitled to give, regardless of what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
dog&rsquo;s master may think, and I only hope it may be
in my power at some future time to bestow upon
Benny a more substantial token of regard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford handed the collar and medal to the
boy as he ceased speaking, and the latter gazed alternately
at the gift and the dog, who was sitting bolt
upright on his hind legs as if begging to be told the
cause of this sudden commotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Sam Hardy said interrogatively as
Benny remained silent. &ldquo;Well, No. 8, ain&rsquo;t there
anything more to it? The dog is coaxin&rsquo; you to
thank the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he is, Mr. Hardy; but how can I do
it?&rdquo; Benny replied with a long-drawn sigh of delight.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s splendid, though it ain&rsquo;t none too good
for a dog like Fluff, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d rather he&rsquo;d have this
than all the money in the world. Just to think!&rdquo;
and the lad turned to address the entire crew.
&ldquo;Fluff has got a regular life-saving medal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big thing,&rdquo; Keeper Downey replied with
a nod of satisfaction, &ldquo;an&rsquo;, what&rsquo;s more, Fluff is
the only one of this crew that has won such a distinction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anything was needed, after the letter from the
Superintendent, to show that he an&rsquo; I were members
of the crew, this would be enough, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as a commission from the Treasury
Department,&rdquo; Joe Cushing replied gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
&ldquo;If you would like to make the change, I can
buy you something, instead of spending so much
money for the dog,&rdquo; Mr. Bradford said, with a
meaning glance at the men. &ldquo;It will be an easy
matter to exchange the collar and medal for cheaper
metal, and give you the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this away from Fluff?&rdquo; Benny cried in
alarm. &ldquo;Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t have it done for the
world! Now I&rsquo;m a regular member of this crew I
don&rsquo;t need anything, an&rsquo; even if I did, he should
have the best, because he&rsquo;s the one who saved your
life, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll get a heap of pleasure out of looking
at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have also sent out here ten pounds of sugar in
lumps, so that you may remind him of me at least
once every day,&rdquo; Mr. Bradford said, apparently
getting as much pleasure out of the presentation as
did Benny, &ldquo;and because of thus rewarding Fluff,
I want you to do me a favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo; Benny asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want the privilege of giving you a full suit of
clothes. Here is an order on a tailor, who will make
whatever you may decide upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While speaking the gentleman had pressed into
Benny&rsquo;s hand a slip of paper, and before the lad
could reply Sam Hardy cried in delight:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course No. 8 will do you the favor of takin&rsquo;
it, an&rsquo;, what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s a mighty lucky thing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
him. Here he has just been made a member of the
crew, but hasn&rsquo;t got a uniform to wear when he
goes into the city. That order, Mr. Bradford, is
just the ticket, and with Fluff C. Foster rigged out
in a solid silver collar with a gold medal of honor,
and Benjamin H. Foster in a regulation suit, brass
buttons an&rsquo; all, this &rsquo;ere station will blossom out in
regular shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was won by the idea of wearing a uniform
like his comrades; but he looked toward Mr. Downey
as if asking his permission to accept the gift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it, my lad, and thank the gentleman by so
doing,&rdquo; the keeper said with a smile. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
more, you shall go into the city with Sam Hardy
to-morrow morning and be measured for the uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a wondrously bright gleam in Benny&rsquo;s
eyes as, taking the dog suddenly in his arms, he
said to the generous visitor:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thank you awfully much, Mr. Bradford, an&rsquo;
you may be sure Fluff will never do anything to
make you ashamed of having given him such a
beautiful collar and medal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE UNIFORM.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Bradford was in no haste to return home on
this evening when he had decorated Fluff and provided
Benny with the means of getting a uniform.</p>

<p>He had come to assure the crew that he fully
appreciated the discipline and prompt attention to
duty which made possible his rescue, for had thirty
seconds been wasted after Sam Hardy&rsquo;s summons,
the boat would have arrived too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never before fully realized the value of life-saving
stations or the heroism of life-saving crews,&rdquo;
he said, addressing Keeper Downey. &ldquo;Perhaps it
was because I never knew what perfection of discipline
and drill was to be found among the men. I
have often wondered why this service should be
under the supervision of the Treasury Department,
when one would naturally expect it to be a branch
of the navy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reason is, Mr. Bradford, that a deep-water
sailor, as a rule, knows very little about surf work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>&rdquo;
Tom Downey replied quickly, and with considerable
warmth. &ldquo;You will find that among all the mariners
we aid, no more than one out of every hundred
has had any experience in making a landing on a
shore like this when the water is rough, and it&rsquo;s
not to be expected of them. The life-saving service
is recruited from shore fishermen&mdash;men who are accustomed
to going back and forth through the surf
in all kinds of weather. Put the best sailor that
ever jockeyed a spar into our surf-boat, and he&rsquo;d
be out of his element, as you can well understand.
Therefore the life-saving service is really the duty of
landsmen, and has nothing to do with such as the
navy would be forced to employ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the visitor could reply Sam Hardy began
making preparations to go on patrol, and Benny felt
it his duty to accompany him, particularly after
having begged permission to share the labor, although
he was eager to hear the remainder of the
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to go out this night,
Benjamin, and I think you are called on to stay here
till Mr. Bradford leaves,&rdquo; Sam said, observing the
expression on the boy&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>No. 8 had no idea of allowing inclination to interfere
with the duties he had assumed, especially now
that he had considered himself a regularly enrolled
member of the crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
&ldquo;Mr. Bradford knows that somebody must go on
patrol, and I&rsquo;ll never be trusted alone if I don&rsquo;t
hurry up with the learning,&rdquo; Benny replied
promptly, putting on the pea-jacket and sou&rsquo;wester
Joe Cushing had given him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will come and see me to-morrow?&rdquo; the
visitor asked, and Sam replied for the lad:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can count on his givin&rsquo; you a call, Mr.
Bradford, although we won&rsquo;t have overly much
time to spend in neighboring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the two shook hands with the gentleman,
and went out into the night on their errand of mercy.</p>

<p>Benny was unusually quiet as they walked along
the bluffs, glancing from time to time over the placid
waters illumined by the moon, and after ten minutes
or more had passed in silence Sam asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has gone wrong with you, No. 8? Ain&rsquo;t
a solid silver collar rich enough for Fluff C. Foster,
or did you think the medal might have been bigger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be terribly ashamed of myself to think anything
like that, Mr. Hardy. Of course the collar
and medal ain&rsquo;t any better than Fluff deserves; but
they&rsquo;re a good deal nicer than I ever thought he&rsquo;d
get, and it makes me feel fine to think of his having
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what is keepin&rsquo; you so glum? You
haven&rsquo;t opened your mouth since we left the
station.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve been thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what, No. 8?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shan&rsquo;t do enough, and that the
crew will find out I ain&rsquo;t coming up to the praise
I&rsquo;m getting. Everybody has been so good to me
since the ship was wrecked, that I can&rsquo;t even begin
to pay it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any danger so long as you have
such thoughts in your head, Benjamin. I don&rsquo;t
believe in praisin&rsquo; boys, as a general thing, because
it&rsquo;s apt to spoil &rsquo;em; but you don&rsquo;t seem to be one
of that kind. Keep on as you&rsquo;ve started, No. 8,
and I guarantee all hands of us will be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sam Hardy told Benny of a boy who had
been saved from a wreck two years previous, and
who was anything rather than an agreeable companion,
following this story with another, until the
four hours passed so quickly that it seemed to No.
8 as if they had not been on duty one quarter of the
required time.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford had started for home nearly two
hours before Benny and Sam came in, their night&rsquo;s
work finished, and no one except Fluff was awake.</p>

<p>He greeted them with his shrill barking, which
Benny checked quickly lest the others should be
awakened, and when the two whose time for duty
had come were aroused, Sam whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll turn in, No. 8, and see to it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
you&rsquo;re up bright and early to-morrow. You&rsquo;re
not to do any work in the kitchen, but will eat
breakfast with the crew, so that we shan&rsquo;t be delayed
in setting out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny did not obey this command strictly. Next
morning when the cook slipped out of bed softly to
avoid disturbing the others, the lad heard and followed
him without delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have had a good half-hour&rsquo;s sleep
before breakfast will be ready, No. 8.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but I wouldn&rsquo;t have done my share
of the work here,&rdquo; Benny replied hesitatingly, for
the cook had spoken sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Members of the crew who have a day&rsquo;s liberty
are not expected to do anything around the station,
and you&rsquo;re down for leave of absence from midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t do what I
can before we leave,&rdquo; Benny replied stoutly as he
set about the usual morning duties, and until breakfast
was on the table he insisted upon aiding the
cook.</p>

<p>Then Sam sternly ordered him to &ldquo;knock-off&rdquo;
and make ready for the journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a five-mile pull before us, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
not of the mind to spend our entire day at the oars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Until this moment Benny had supposed they
would walk from the station to the city, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
learning that Sam intended to make the journey in
the dory which the crew used for fishing, a certain
wistful expression came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what have you got on your mind, No. 8?&rdquo;
Sam asked, quick to note the change on the
boy&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering&mdash;I thought&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose
you&rsquo;d want to take Fluff, Mr. Hardy. He&rsquo;s been
in a boat very often, and knows how to behave
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid Maje will make trouble if you leave him
behind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it wasn&rsquo;t that; but you see he won&rsquo;t
have many chances to go away from the station,
and I want him to show his collar and medal whenever
it&rsquo;s possible. He had a bath yesterday, and is
as clean as a whistle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t go, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m not certain but Mr. Bradford would like to see
him rigged out in his finery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny no longer gave any heed to his breakfast,
but spent all the remaining time in combing Fluff&rsquo;s
silken hair, and when Sam Hardy announced that
he was ready to start, the dog was looking his best,
with the medal hanging in the most conspicuous
position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking a good deal finer than you are,
No. 8,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said with a laugh. &ldquo;That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
gorgeous collar don&rsquo;t correspond with your old pea-jacket
and sou&rsquo;-wester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make any difference about me, so long
as he&rsquo;s the way Mrs. Clark always wanted to see
him,&rdquo; Benny replied, choking back a sob as his
mind thus involuntarily went into the past. &ldquo;Folks
wouldn&rsquo;t notice a boy like me, but they always
stare when Fluff walks along looking like everything
belonged to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till you&rsquo;re togged out in a uniform, No. 8,
and then I&rsquo;ll answer for it you get as much attention
from the people as does Fluff. I&rsquo;m going
into town with you then, and what a dash we&rsquo;ll
cut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe Cushing laughed in anticipation of that moment,
and while he was thus amused Sam beckoned
Benny to follow him.</p>

<p>The dory was lying near the water&rsquo;s edge, and it
only required that she should be launched in order
to begin the journey.</p>

<p>Fluff took his place in the stern-sheets as if accustomed
to this method of travelling; Sam took up
the oars, refusing most decidedly Benny&rsquo;s proposal
that he be allowed to do his share of the rowing,
and as the boat glided out of the little cove the
crew at the station cheered right heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds as if they were glad to be rid of us,&rdquo;
Benny suggested, and Sam replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their way of showin&rsquo; that they&rsquo;ll be
pleased to see you back. I might leave a dozen
times, an&rsquo; nobody would so much as poke his nose
out of the door to see if I got away all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they count on your coming home just the
same,&rdquo; Benny replied earnestly, as if thinking his
comrade might be jealous because more attention
was bestowed upon a newcomer than on himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon they do, No. 8; but an old fellow like
me don&rsquo;t cut any such figger as does a boy, an&rsquo; a
dog what&rsquo;s wearin&rsquo; a medal of honor,&rdquo; and Sam
Hardy laughed heartily, whereat Benny began to
understand that no jealousy lurked in his heart.</p>

<p>A most enjoyable voyage did this prove to be for
No. 8 and Fluff, even though the temperature was
many degrees below freezing and the wind piercing
cold. Sam Hardy did not appear to be in any very
great hurry to reach the city, once he had put off
from the station, but told stories of heroism displayed
by his comrades, at the same time that he
fed the dog liberally with lumps of sugar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out for a holiday,&rdquo; he said when Benny
suggested that it was not well for Fluff to have such
a feast, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m countin&rsquo; on his enjoyin&rsquo; it as well
as us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it may make him sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it will teach him not to be so greedy
another time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he won&rsquo;t remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most likely not, No. 8, most likely not. Boys
an&rsquo; dogs are much alike in that particular&mdash;they
won&rsquo;t learn by experience. Did you ever think
what a wise lad he would be who was eager to learn
by the experience of others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was considerably puzzled by this remark,
and the surfman continued gravely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at it in this light, lad: you&rsquo;ve been
thrown with them as were older than yourself a good
portion of the time you&rsquo;ve lived in this world.
You&rsquo;ve heard of this one&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; what people call
&rsquo;bad luck,&rsquo; or of that one&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; some foolish thing.
Now suppose you&rsquo;d stored all that up in your
memory. Wouldn&rsquo;t you be able to steer clear of
the first man&rsquo;s bad luck, an&rsquo; keep yourself from
committin&rsquo; the same folly you condemned in the
other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny nodded gravely. This proposition was
something entirely new to him, and he believed it
to be a most valuable suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boy who was willing to learn from the experience
of others would soon be wiser than the average
run of lads, and, what&rsquo;s more, he&rsquo;d save himself
many a sore time; but it ain&rsquo;t done by young people
any more than Fluff will remember, in case he&rsquo;s
sick to-morrow, that the next time sugar&rsquo;s offered
him he should be less greedy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was so interested in this method of acquiring
knowledge that he continued to discuss the matter
until the dory was made fast alongside one of the
city piers, and Sam said laughingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d best not spend any more of our
time discussin&rsquo; the matter; it&rsquo;ll serve us out on
patrol bright nights, when there&rsquo;s little call to keep
a very sharp lookout. Now we&rsquo;re bound for Mr.
Bradford&rsquo;s office, and then to the tailor&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;ll
be a terrible swell before many days, No. 8.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to wear the uniform except when
I go into the city, so there&rsquo;s no danger of my doing
very much swelling,&rdquo; Benny replied with a laugh,
and then Sam Hardy was ready to lead the way to
the sportsman&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>No. 8 did not dare allow Fluff to walk through
the streets lest some evil-disposed dog should pick
a quarrel with him; but he took good care both the
collar and medal could be seen while the little fellow
was in his arms.</p>

<p>Their reception by Mr. Bradford was exceedingly
friendly&mdash;almost too much so, Benny thought,
when the gentleman insisted on introducing them
to his acquaintances, and telling the story of the
rescue.</p>

<p>The dog was petted as perhaps he never had been
before, which was pleasing to his master; but, as
Benny afterward told Sam Hardy confidentially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
there was no reason why he should be praised for
what Fluff C. Foster had done.</p>

<p>Then the little party went to the tailor, who was
ordered to make a uniform exactly like the one worn
by Sam Hardy, and, in addition, a second suit of
clothes was decided upon, so that the boy might
have a proper outfit when the time came for him to
go to school.</p>

<p>The surfman, No. 8, and Fluff dined with Mr.
Bradford on this day, after which they were treated
to a carriage ride, and so eager was the gentleman
to give them pleasure that but for Sam Hardy&rsquo;s
persistency in setting out on the return voyage at
an early hour, they might not have succeeded in regaining
the station until late in the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been what you might call a great day,
No. 8,&rdquo; the surfman said when they had bidden
their entertainer adieu on the pier and the dory was
out of the harbor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain but that two
such outings as this would spoil you an&rsquo; Fluff C.
Foster for work at the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a good time, and Mr. Bradford has
been very kind,&rdquo; Benny said thoughtfully; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m not so sure as I&rsquo;d like to try it over again very
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, in the first place, I don&rsquo;t deserve it,
even if Fluff does; and then again, it ain&rsquo;t very nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
to have folks praising you up when there&rsquo;s no
reason for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think Mr. Bradford had any
right to lay it on quite so thick about what you&rsquo;d
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, because it wasn&rsquo;t altogether true. Any
fellow who was all alone in this world with a dog
like Fluff, would work mighty hard if folks gave
him a home, same&rsquo;s the crew have given me, so
what I do don&rsquo;t count. Now if Mr. Bradford had
told the people we met how good you all were to
take us, I&rsquo;d had a much better time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too modest, Benjamin, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a
fault every boy don&rsquo;t have, I&rsquo;m sorry to say. Now
about that uniform of yours. You didn&rsquo;t so much
as ask me when it was to be sent out to the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have looked very well to be in a
hurry when some one makes me such a splendid
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wouldn&rsquo;t, eh? Well, the toggery
wasn&rsquo;t for me, therefore I had no call to be so
bashful. The uniform is to be ready in four days,
and about that time Tom Downey will be goin&rsquo; into
town. The other clothes are to be finished in a
week. When they come we&rsquo;ll&mdash;Hello, what&rsquo;s
that steamer layin&rsquo; off there for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dory was almost within sight of the station
when Sam Hardy ceased rowing very suddenly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
gaze at a steamer which appeared to be at anchor a
mile or more off the shore, and Benny was wholly
at a loss to understand why his companion had become
so thoroughly excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t seem to be in any trouble,&rdquo; he ventured
to say, and Sam settling down to the oars as
if believing he had a severe task before him, replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her captain is huntin&rsquo; for it, if he comes to
anchor in that place without precious good reasons.
A shoal makes out just there, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve seen two
good vessels go to pieces on it. That steamer is
aground, Benny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing startling to the lad in this announcement.
The craft lay as if afloat; the wind
was not strong enough to raise a very heavy sea,
and nothing indicated any sudden change in the
weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that it don&rsquo;t mean very much now,
lad,&rdquo; the surfman continued as if reading his companion&rsquo;s
thoughts; &ldquo;but on this coast at this time
of the year, no one can say when everything may be
changed. There! The captain is beginning to
understand that matters ain&rsquo;t altogether lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The steamer&rsquo;s whistle had begun to sound a
whistle that help of some kind was required, and
Benny believed the captain was calling upon the
life-saving crew for assistance, until Sam said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s whistlin&rsquo; for a tug; but with the wind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
this quarter it ain&rsquo;t likely to do much good, unless
she is sighted by one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our crew will see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before sunset, when the patrol goes out;
but they&rsquo;ll hear the whistle, an&rsquo; find her by that
means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam was rowing at his best speed, and Benny
watched eagerly for the appearance of the life-saving
crew, but no one had appeared in sight when the
dory was brought within hailing distance of the
stranded steamer.</p>

<p>The rail was lined with heads, showing that she
had passengers aboard, and on the bridge was a
group of officers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boat ahoy!&rdquo; some one shouted, and Sam replied,
standing up as he did, so that his uniform
might be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a member of a life-saving crew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir; the station is a mile and a half away
around the point. Are you in need of assistance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want tugs. Can you telephone from your
quarters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask that two steamers be sent at once. We&rsquo;re
not heavily aground; but to such an extent that our
engines are of no avail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we take off your passengers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of it. We can lie here easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
enough, if it isn&rsquo;t possible to haul us off before
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain of that, sir. The tide will
fall twelve inches or more before the ebb, and the
water hereabouts is rough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send a message for me to the city, and that will
be enough,&rdquo; the master replied curtly, and Sam
took up the oars again, pulling vigorously toward
the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s what you call a pig-headed captain,&rdquo;
he said when the dory was some distance away.
&ldquo;It stands to reason he doesn&rsquo;t know anything
about this coast, else he&rsquo;d never gone on that shoal,
an&rsquo; he had too good an opinion of his own abilities
to so much as look at the chart. There are no tugs
around here that can pull him off before high tide,
and in the meanwhile he&rsquo;s likely to find that the
steamer won&rsquo;t lay as easy as he&rsquo;s countin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There comes our surf-boat!&rdquo; Benny cried,
pointing toward a projecting cliff which hid the
station from view, and around which the life-saving
crew were just appearing. &ldquo;I knew they&rsquo;d
answer the steamer&rsquo;s signal as soon as it could be
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they would, lad, there are no sleepy
heads among us, if I do say it. Tom Downey will
read that captain a lecture, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dory and the surf-boat were soon side by side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
and the keeper asked for information concerning the
steamer.</p>

<p>Sam repeated the conversation he had had with
the captain, and Mr. Downey replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send the message as soon as you get back, and
then go on duty at once, taking up a station directly
opposite where the steamer lies. Flash the Coston
twice if she&rsquo;s likely to need us between now and
midnight. Joe Cushing shall cover the remainder
of your beat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then word was given for the crew to &ldquo;pull
away,&rdquo; and Sam bent to his oars as if time was very
precious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Downey think it is possible the
steamer can come to any harm in such pleasant
weather?&rdquo; Benny asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what may happen, lad, and
Downey don&rsquo;t intend to get himself into trouble if
it can be prevented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What trouble can come to him if the captain of
the steamer won&rsquo;t allow the crew to do anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In case there should be loss of life, even after
what&rsquo;s been said and done, all hands of us would
be called for an explanation as to why we didn&rsquo;t do
our duty. Let any trouble come to that steamer,
an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re bound to stand an investigation, for the
Superintendent of the Service is mighty sharp in
such affairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny could not understand how it might be possible
to blame a crew who had not been allowed to
give their services, and Sam was too deeply intent
on the business in hand to go into any lengthy
explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figger it all out for you some time when
we&rsquo;re on patrol,&rdquo; he said, and No. 8 understood
from the tone of his voice that the surfman was not
inclined to indulge further in conversation.</p>

<p>When, ten minutes later, the dory was pulled into
the little cove near the station, Sam Hardy landed
hurriedly, calling out to Benny as he did so:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make her fast, lad, and follow me. I&rsquo;ll set the
cook to work on our supper, for we&rsquo;re not likely to
have another chance for anything to eat till midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No. 8 did as he was bidden, and when he entered
the station Sam was just coming from the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little show of getting two tugs out to
the steamer much before high water, and I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo; the captain may be obliged to call on us
after all, unless he&rsquo;s shipped a different set of passengers
than usually travel. Turn to an&rsquo; fill yourself
up with coffee and hearty food, Benjamin, for
we&rsquo;ve got a long stretch of patrol duty ahead, if
nothing worse comes of this night&rsquo;s business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE STRANDED STEAMER.</span></h2>

<p>Benny delayed in carrying out the instructions
given by Sam Hardy only sufficiently long to remove
Fluff&rsquo;s collar and medal, and after that but
little time was spent in &ldquo;filling himself up,&rdquo; because
the excitement had driven away what small remnant
of appetite was left after the feast which Mr. Bradford
had set before them.</p>

<p>Fluff, wearied perhaps by the attentions bestowed
upon him in the city, was perfectly willing to occupy
the bed which the cook made up for him near the
kitchen stove, and failed to exhibit any sign of displeasure
when his young master left him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s had all the excursion he wants in
one day,&rdquo; Benny said as he followed Sam out into
the fast gathering gloom, and the latter replied
sagely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dogs are much like boys, No. 8, as I&rsquo;ve said
before. They think of nothin&rsquo; but pleasure while
the fun is goin&rsquo; on, an&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s over are disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
to pay more attention to their own weariness than
duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Fluff couldn&rsquo;t help staying in the city just
as long as we were there,&rdquo; Benny said, as if thinking
some apology was needed for the dog. &ldquo;He
would have been willing enough to come home if
we&rsquo;d shown him the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say he would, Benny, I dare say he
would; and now we&rsquo;ll turn our attention to the
work before us instead of givin&rsquo; any heed to boys or
dogs. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; the captain of that steamer
will change his mind about landing the passengers
when he learns that the tugs can&rsquo;t get to him for
quite a spell, an&rsquo; after he takes note of that fog-bank
to seaward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny gazed in the direction indicated by the
surfman&rsquo;s outstretched hand, but failed to distinguish
anything which betokened fog, until Sam
called his attention to a dark line along the horizon,
and also to the fact that there was a decided
change in the temperature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a smother upon us in less than half
an hour, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s fortunate I brought an extra supply
of Coston signals. That&rsquo;s another case, No. 8,
where people would talk of luck, an&rsquo; yet it was only
reasonable foresight, such as any man ought to
exercise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam was making his way along the coast at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
best pace, which was so rapid that at times Benny
was forced to run, and when ten minutes had passed
the boy asked, panting for breath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you hurrying? All the crew are out
to the steamer, and a watch ashore won&rsquo;t be needed
until quite a while after they have come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, lad; but it&rsquo;s necessary to get the location
of the ship well fixed in mind before the fog shuts
down. Once that has been done we can go out to
her without any great trouble, providin&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two arrived none too soon at the post they
were to occupy.</p>

<p>On gaining the bluff opposite the steamer, the
mist, which had been rapidly creeping over the
ocean, had already begun to envelop her, and no
more than the spars could be distinguished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes&rsquo; delay, and we&rsquo;d have been too
late, not only to make her out, but to hear what
orders Tom Downey may have to give,&rdquo; the surfman
said, and Benny could faintly distinguish amid
the vapor a dark spot which he understood, because
of Sam Hardy&rsquo;s words, to be the surf-boat coming
shoreward.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the crew rested on their oars
within an hundred feet of the bluff, as the keeper
shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you send a message to the city?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, and there will be no tugs here much
before high water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your ears open for the steamer&rsquo;s whistle,
which will be sounded three times if the captain decides
that he needs assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what then, sir? It will be hard making
out such a signal as that now the fog-horn has begun
to blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as if the keeper had only realized this fact
by thus being reminded of it, and after a brief consultation
with the crew he shouted again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come ashore on that bit of shingle just
below, and you may join us there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said this he gave some order to the men,
and the surf-boat was pulled out to sea again, disappearing
almost immediately in the fog which had by
this time reached the land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are they coming ashore?&rdquo; Benny asked
as Sam Hardy set out northward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He counts on havin&rsquo; the surf-boat in case she
may be needed, for, if this smother clears away before
the moon rises, there&rsquo;ll be a sea on that will
trouble yonder steamer considerably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam followed the trend on the shore a hundred
yards or more, coming to a halt where a narrow
strip of pebbly beach lay between two frowning
walls of rock, and Benny said to himself that it
would not be possible, however familiar the life-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>saving
crew were with the coast, for them to find
their way through this dangerous passage while the
fog was so dense that objects a dozen feet away
could hardly be distinguished.</p>

<p>In this he was mistaken, however. The men had
been forced many times, either to save their own
lives or in the aid of others, to pursue quite as blind
a course, and two or three minutes later the surf-boat
came between the frowning walls against which
the waves were already beginning to dash with an
ominous moan.</p>

<p>Now Benny had an opportunity of observing how
much labor might be required of the life-saving
crew when it became necessary to take precautions.</p>

<p>The captain of the stranded steamer had refused
to allow his passengers to be taken off when it
might have been done without difficulty, and now,
aground as she was, much danger was to be apprehended.
This could be guarded against only by
leaving the surf-boat where she might readily be
launched. At the same time the remainder of the
coast must be patrolled lest other ships needed assistance,
and the crew were forced to perform all
their regular duties while remaining on the alert to
answer a call from this point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose the steamer should whistle for assistance,
and at the same time a vessel went ashore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
other side of the station?&rdquo; Benny asked. &ldquo;How
could one crew attend to both?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be the keeper&rsquo;s duty to decide which
craft was in the greatest danger, or, if both were in
much the same position, where the largest number
of lives might be saved, and then one or the other
would be left to her fate. There&rsquo;s where the responsibility
of the keeper comes in, my son, and a
heavy one it is like to be under certain circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surf-boat had been hauled up beyond reach
of the tide when it should rise, and all the men
ordered out on patrol.</p>

<p>There was no time to be spent in eating supper,
for the most dreaded of all dangers upon the Eastern
coast had suddenly presented itself, and the life-saving
crew must labor to the utmost extent of their
powers without thought or heed of self until, perchance,
exhaustion should overcome them.</p>

<p>Sam and Benny were left alone, and a long,
dreary vigil did they keep, although the surfman
tried to enliven it for the lad by telling stories, or
explaining again and again the duties of each member
of the crew under supposititious circumstances.</p>

<p>The fog hung low and dense until nearly midnight,
when the wind had so increased in force that
it was &ldquo;blown away,&rdquo; to use Sam Hardy&rsquo;s expression,
and the steamer revealed to view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
That the surf had been rising all this time the
watchers on shore knew full well by the roaring and
pounding of the waves upon the rocks, but yet even
Sam Hardy, experienced in such matters as he was,
betrayed surprise when the lifting of the fog revealed
the situation of the stranded steamer.</p>

<p>At the time she was first discovered the vessel lay
motionless as if at anchor in a quiet haven; now the
heavy swell, dashing over the shoal, was so high
that at times it seemed as if the steamer&rsquo;s decks
must be flooded, and Sam Hardy cried anxiously
and impatiently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t that pig-headed captain signal for
assistance? I&rsquo;ve seen a craft more staunch than
she knocked to pieces by the surf when there wasn&rsquo;t
half a gale of wind, an&rsquo; now we&rsquo;re likely to have
before mornin&rsquo; all the breeze that a water-borne
craft can stagger under, to say nothin&rsquo; of one that&rsquo;s
aground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; until daylight,&rdquo; Benny
suggested, and his companion replied with a note
of anger in his voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he does it&rsquo;ll be too late, for in that shallow
water we couldn&rsquo;t get a life-boat to her, an&rsquo; the time
has already passed when we might be able to use
the surf-boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five minutes later the two watchers on shore saw,
coming around the point, the heavy boat from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
station, and understood that Keeper Downey believed
the moment had arrived when assistance
should be rendered, even though as yet it had not
been asked for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon the cook is No. 1 in that crew,&rdquo;
Sam muttered half to himself as he watched the
buoyant craft toss like an egg-shell on the heavy
waters. &ldquo;Downey might at least have sent him
out here, an&rsquo; let me take my proper place, for now
the life-boat has been launched there&rsquo;s little need
of keepin&rsquo; a man on duty at this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a brave sight to see that staunch boat
breasting the waves which at times appeared to raise
her literally on end, but yet steadily continuing the
course, and the timid ones aboard the stranded
steamer must have hailed her as a thing of beauty
and of mercy.</p>

<p>Benny had never seen the life-boat in service, and
so engrossed was he with the spectacle that he could
give no attention to anything else.</p>

<p>By this time not a vestige of fog could be seen.
The stars were twinkling brightly in the sky, and,
save for the tremendous wind which seemed gathering
force every instant, one would have said that
there was no fear of disaster alongshore.</p>

<p>The life-boat ran down the coast, heading directly
for the steamer until she was within perhaps an
eighth of a mile, when, turning, she put straight out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
to sea in the teeth of the wind as if running away
from the stranded vessel, and Benny cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Downey&rsquo;s afraid to go any nearer; but
why doesn&rsquo;t he come back to the station?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart, lad, he&rsquo;s countin&rsquo; on boardin&rsquo;
that craft as soon as may be; but with such a sea
runnin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; over that shallow water which is like to
let the life-boat down on the shoal when she gets
into the trough of the sea, he&rsquo;s bound to take every
precaution. Now! He&rsquo;s cast the grapnel, an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll see them drop back as close aboard the
steamer as can be done with safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre was performed rapidly, and with
the least possible delay.</p>

<p>Almost before Sam had ceased speaking the life-boat
was lost to view on the starboard side of the
steamer, and there she remained so long that the
surfman cried impatiently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can they be doin&rsquo;? Surely there has
been time enough to take off a full load, an&rsquo; Tom
Downey knows as well as any other man, that in an
hour from now no craft ever put together by human
hands can lay over that shoal without being dashed
to pieces on the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was soon seen, however, that Tom Downey
was not delaying, for presently the life-boat was
pulled up to her grapnel, and then headed for the
station, with none save the regular crew on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Now it was that Sam Hardy lost his temper entirely;
he stormed and scolded, shaking his fist
toward the stranded craft until, almost in alarm,
Benny asked the reason of his excitement:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that again the commander of the
steamer has refused assistance? Tom Downey went
off believin&rsquo; the pig-headed master would realize
the danger by this time, an&rsquo; counted on bringin&rsquo;
the passengers ashore; but he&rsquo;s been sent away
empty-handed, and when that captain comes to his
senses it&rsquo;ll be too late for us to give him any assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, Mr. Downey has done all a man can,
and if anything happens now it&rsquo;s the master of the
steamer who is responsible,&rdquo; Benny said soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t relieve us from some shadow of
blame in case anything happens. We shall be raked
over the coals if that craft goes to pieces, an&rsquo; Downey
will be forced to explain why he didn&rsquo;t insist on
saving the passengers, if not the crew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t if the captain refused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True for you, lad; but it&rsquo;ll hurt us all the same,
for the crew of a life-saving station feels a certain
degree of responsibility for every life lost in their
district, and thus far our record has been exceptionally
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was useless for Sam to scold and fret.</p>

<p>The circumstances could not be altered, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
he might do was to stand on the shore watching
the increasing violence of the waters, knowing full
well that each moment lessened the chances of
rendering assistance to the stranded steamer.</p>

<p>Then came Joe Cushing, who was doing patrol
duty on that portion of the shore, and Sam asked
for the particulars of the life-boat&rsquo;s voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we came alongside Downey explained to
the skipper what was like to be the condition of
affairs an hour later; but couldn&rsquo;t beat any sense
into his head. He refused to allow a single passenger
to leave, although many of them were anxious
to do so; but asked again that we send another message
into the city for tugs,&rdquo; Joe Cushing replied.
&ldquo;It seems that the craft hasn&rsquo;t taken ground so
badly but that she could be pulled off with her own
engines, by the aid of a couple of tugs, an&rsquo; the
master declares she&rsquo;ll stand more poundin&rsquo; than
she&rsquo;s likely to receive this night, all of which may
be true. Just as we were leavin&rsquo; he asked the
keeper to have the crew on hand in case he decided
later to land with his own boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With his own boats in this surf!&rdquo; Sam Hardy
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s what he allowed. Of course Tom
Downey told him it couldn&rsquo;t be done, an&rsquo; said all
a man might to dissuade him from makin&rsquo; such an
attempt. Then we came away, an&rsquo; Sam, you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
as well as I, that now there&rsquo;s no crew in this or any
other country that can put out across the shoal an&rsquo;
get back with their boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know it, of course I do!&rdquo; Sam Hardy cried,
and then for ten minutes or more the two surfmen
discussed the situation angrily, but without making
matters any better, save perhaps it might be that
their own minds were relieved by much talking, after
which Joe Cushing went on patrol again.</p>

<p>When he was gone Benny asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we to stay here, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad, until we starve, unless Tom Downey
orders us in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wind was piercing cold, and the two on the
shore were exposed to its full force while they remained
where it was possible to keep the steamer in
view.</p>

<p>Sam urged Benny to find a sheltered spot where
he might be partially screened from the wind; but
the lad refused, saying decidedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been ordered here, sir, the same as you
were, and I&rsquo;ll do what any other member of the
crew would in my place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, No. 8; but I hold to it that there&rsquo;s
such a thing as havin&rsquo; too much grit. You want to
toughen up; but you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; too strong at the
start. If you&rsquo;re bound to hold on, keep pace with
me while I trot around here a spell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the two paced back and forth along the
rocky coast nearly an hour when, although constantly
expecting it, they were startled by the
steamer&rsquo;s shrill whistle.</p>

<p>Three blasts blown, and Sam Hardy exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s come to his senses at last; but when it&rsquo;s
too late! Now, whatever happens, he&rsquo;ll say he
was &lsquo;unlucky,&rsquo; although we know it was nothin&rsquo;
but sheer willfulness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; Benny asked, as if thinking
they must immediately set to work in an attempt
to answer this call for assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the keeper to say. If I was in his
place I&rsquo;d get the beach-wagon over here, for the
boats are of no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I run back toward the station so&rsquo;s to
help them in case they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; with the cart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Benny. Our orders were to stay here, an&rsquo;
here we&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To show that the call for assistance was heard and
understood, Sam Hardy flashed his Coston signal, and
less than half an hour later the crew from the station
came up at full speed, but without the beach-wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make one fight with the surf-boat,&rdquo; Tom
Downey said hurriedly to Sam, &ldquo;and if that proves
useless, as I reckon it will, we&rsquo;ll try to send a line
aboard, although there&rsquo;s little show it can be done
while she lays so far from shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardy joined the crew as they ran toward the
surf-boat, which was hauled up on shore a short distance
away, and Benny wondered that he should be
so willing to make the attempt when but a short time
previous he had declared it an absolute impossibility
they could gain the steamer&rsquo;s side in either boat.</p>

<p>Now the lad saw for the second time what an
heroic struggle <i>his</i> crew could make against almost
insurmountable difficulties.</p>

<p>Across the shoal the sea was running wildly, while
inshore the spray dashed so high as to completely
hide the steamer from view at times.</p>

<p>It seemed little short of madness to put out even
in the staunch life-boat, yet Tom Downey and his
brave fellows made the venture without hesitation.</p>

<p>With three on either side and the keeper at the
stern, they waited with the surf-boat close at the
water-line until the heavy swell had broken upon
the shore and was receding, when, following it, they
ran into the waves breast-deep, leaping aboard their
craft instantly she was water-borne.</p>

<p>Benny literally held his breath in suspense as,
under the impulse of six oars, the surf-boat was
forced out into that tumult of waters, and ere
she had sailed a hundred yards the heavy waves,
striking her bow, lifted her up, up, up, until she
was literally pitch-poled backwards, throwing every
member of the crew into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
A cry of horror burst from the lad&rsquo;s lips as he ran
down to the pebbly beach, fancying his puny
strength might avail in that terrific struggle which
must ensue, for he had good reason to fear that not
one of his comrades would reach the shore alive.</p>

<p>The men had prepared themselves for this battle
by throwing off all superfluous clothing, despite the
chilling wind, and now was shown the advantage
which they had over deep-water sailors, for, knowing
every trend of the current along the coast, and
accustomed to avail themselves of it under all conditions
of weather, it was possible for them to do
what one who had not been bred to such dangers
would have lost his life in doing.</p>

<p>The lad who stood trembling with apprehension
on the shore was literally amazed at seeing one after
another of the sturdy fellows emerge from the foaming
waters, and make his way ashore either by
creeping on his hands and knees, or, throwing himself
backward upon the crest of a wave, and allow
the volume of water to sweep him upon the beach
even at the risk of dashing him against the rocks.</p>

<p>No more than ten minutes had elapsed from the
time the surf-boat put out before the last member
of the crew was on the cliff, all bruised and beaten
more or less, but alive and ready for further duty,
even at a time when such a duty seemed impossible.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">IN THE SURF.</span></h2>

<p>A new day was breaking when the life-saving crew
were beat back upon the shore by the waves after
their heroic but vain struggle in the surf-boat.</p>

<p>The wind gave evidence of gaining strength as
the sun rose, and steadily the waves increased in
violence. Now they were dashing against the
steamer with the same force as upon the rocky cliffs,
and to those ashore it appeared as if every billow of
foaming water passed directly over the stranded
vessel.</p>

<p>In the minds of the life-saving crew, at least, it
was no longer simply a question of the passengers&rsquo;
discomfort, but whether the steamer could withstand
the terrific beating and pounding to which she
was subjected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must either go to pieces, or be driven
nearer inshore,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said, when the crew
halted for a moment upon the cliff after their terrible
struggle with the surf, and his mates fully agreed
with that conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
It was more than probable the captain of the
steamer had by this time taken quite as gloomy a
view of the situation, for he continued to sound his
signals of distress, although, as Sam Hardy said impatiently,
&ldquo;he should have had sufficient sense to
know that everything in human power would be
done to aid him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may be ignorant of the waters round about
here, and have an idea that a tug can get near
enough to pass him a hawser,&rdquo; Dick Sawyer suggested,
and Keeper Downey replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will only be necessary for him to look at his
chart, which he had better have done yesterday
afternoon, in order to learn that no help can be expected
from seaward. I am at a loss to know just
what is wisest to do, and ask each of you to give
his opinion. The tide is now so low that we cannot
hope to get the life-boat over the shoals. Perhaps
there&rsquo;s one chance in twenty, by putting out into
deep water, we might drop down so near as to take
off a few; but certain it is all could not be brought
ashore in that manner. The question to be decided
is, whether we shall make such an attempt, or put
forth all our efforts toward getting a line aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men gave an opinion according to their
station numbers, Sam Hardy speaking first, as a
matter of course, and his view of the situation appeared
to be that of all the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m ready to try what can be done with
the life-boat, and will go aboard of her cheerfully,
to my mind there are too many chances of failure&mdash;which
would probably mean death to all concerned&mdash;and
too few of success to warrant making the
attempt. I believe, as Joe Cushing does, that if
the steamer isn&rsquo;t stove by the waves she must be
driven nearer ashore, in which case we can get a
line out to her. Therefore I vote that we put all
our dependence upon what may be done from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Learning that the others were of the same opinion,
and understanding that they might not have
very much time at their disposal, Keeper Downey
at once gave the necessary orders for setting about
this last plan of rescue, which necessitated the
bringing up of the beach-apparatus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 1 and No. 8 are to remain here on duty in
order to prevent, if possible, by signal, any effort of
the captain toward landing with his own boats, as
he suggested,&rdquo; Tom Downey said, speaking hurriedly.
&ldquo;The remainder of the crew will go back
to the station with me for the beach-wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exercise was what the men most needed, wet to
the skin as they were after the battle in the surf,
and as soon as the order was given they set off
at full speed, while Sam Hardy was left with Benny
upon the cliff to bear the discomforts as best they
might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
&ldquo;You ought to have gone with the others,&rdquo; No.
8 said solicitously. &ldquo;Your wet clothes will be
frozen long before they can get back, and it don&rsquo;t
seem to me as if there was much need of keeping
anybody out here in the wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is necessary, lad, if for no other reason than
that the order has been given. In Tom Downey&rsquo;s
place I should have made much the same arrangement.
Some one of the crew must grin an&rsquo; bear it
in wet clothing, an&rsquo; because of havin&rsquo; first been
stationed here, I&rsquo;m the one to bear the brunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will freeze to death,&rdquo; Benny cried
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite so bad as that, lad, for I&rsquo;ll keep
movin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; and Sam suited the action to the
words, Benny following close by his side as the surfman
ran swiftly to and fro, beating his arms upon
his breast for additional exercise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t always get it quite as tough
as this,&rdquo; Sam said when he halted to regain his
breath after ten minutes of this most violent exertion,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; then again, there are times when it
comes harder; so you see, lad, that belonging to a
life-saving crew ain&rsquo;t quite as pleasant as you may
have thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t count it was an easy life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can see now that it&rsquo;s best you don&rsquo;t
hold to the idea of bein&rsquo; one of &rsquo;em.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was going to be discouraged because of
hard work on such a job as this, then I&rsquo;d best not
think of ever bein&rsquo; a surfman,&rdquo; Benny replied
stoutly. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t on my own account that I
said anything; my clothes are dry, and I can keep
warm; but I was afraid you&rsquo;d freeze after having
been overboard so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gritty little chap,&rdquo; Sam said admiringly,
&ldquo;almost too much so for one of your years
an&rsquo; build; but don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;ve been
in worse places than this, an&rsquo; never come to any
great harm. If it wasn&rsquo;t that all the work might
have been done readily an&rsquo; without risk, I shouldn&rsquo;t
feel like grumblin&rsquo;; but when a man realizes that
the situation has all come about through a pig-headed
captain who wouldn&rsquo;t allow we knew
anything of the coast, then it seems tough. Howsomever,
we&rsquo;re in a box, an&rsquo; have not only got to
get out of it ourselves, but pull others with us,&mdash;an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll do it, No. 8, we&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sam resumed the exercise, Benny copying
his every movement, and thus alternately running
and halting to regain breath, the two passed
the time until they could see in the distance
the crew, dragging the beach-wagon over the
rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that the apparatus is here it can&rsquo;t be used
while the steamer lays so far off,&rdquo; Hardy said half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
to himself, and at that instant a cry of dismay caused
him to gaze seaward.</p>

<p>When the waves began to run high the master of
the vessel had gotten out anchors fore and aft to
prevent her from being driven shoreward.</p>

<p>The parting of the stern cables had caused the cry
of dismay from Benny, and as Sam looked in that
direction the ships stern was swung violently around
until she lay broadside to the waves, in such position
as proved that she would soon be driven inshore
virtually a wreck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ll be able to put a line aboard of
her mighty soon,&rdquo; Sam said grimly, waving his arms
to attract the attention of the crew that they might
hasten their movements, and Benny, seeing an opportunity
to be of some slight assistance, ran at full
speed to meet the wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; Keeper Downey asked,
as the lad joined him at the rear of the cart, the
cook holding Sam Hardy&rsquo;s station at the handle-bar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stern cable has parted, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shove her along, boys! Shove her along!
We&rsquo;ll be able to get a line out now,&rdquo; and as the
men strained yet more energetically at the ropes
and the handle-bar, Benny put all his little strength
into the effort, performing, as Joe Cushing afterward
said, &ldquo;considerably more than half a man&rsquo;s
work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam Hardy also joined the crew, and the wagon
had no more than been hauled down to the strip of
pebbly beach, the only point from which the work
could be carried on, when the life savers had yet
further evidence of the captain&rsquo;s &ldquo;pig-headedness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he laid alongside the steamer, while urging
that the passengers at least be taken ashore, Tom
Downey had said all a man might to prevent the
master from holding to the plan of launching his
own boats; and yet despite such advice, which
should have been considered well worthy of being
followed, that very man&oelig;uvre was now about to be
attempted.</p>

<p>The life-saving crew could see that one of the port
boats was being hoisted out, and every man ashore
knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that such a
craft could not live five minutes in that boiling,
yeasty swirl of waters.</p>

<p>With a hope of yet persuading the wilful captain,
Tom Downey ignited a Coston signal, and, waving
it violently above his head, showed as plainly as
man might by such means, that there was danger
in the contemplated move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me as if deep-water sailors lose their
heads at such a time,&rdquo; Joe Cushing cried, observing
that the work went on aboard the steamer despite
the keeper&rsquo;s warnings. &ldquo;The captain must have
seen that we failed to keep the surf-boat on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
bottom, but yet he expects to do with his cockleshell
what we couldn&rsquo;t with a craft built especially
for the purpose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe was not the only member of the crew who
criticised harshly the methods of the steamer&rsquo;s commander;
every man gave words to the indignation
in his heart, but yet the foolhardy work went on
rapidly, as if those on board the stranded craft were
eager to meet their doom.</p>

<p>That they were anxious to leave their steamer
seemed probable, even to Benny, for the waves
were now rolling completely over her, and at every
surge she was driven higher and higher up on the
shoal until the surfmen began to fear she would be
rolled completely over.</p>

<p>The work of making ready to send out a line was
begun as soon as the wagon had been placed in
position, and the men labored none the less energetically
and expeditiously because they glanced
from time to time at the tiny boat swinging at the
davits, in which the steamer&rsquo;s crew were taking
their stations.</p>

<p>The gun was not yet loaded when the boat, with
a crew of eight men, dropped into the water at a
moment when the receding waves made such a
man&oelig;uvre possible, and then, to the surprise of the
life savers, all the sailors were seen working at the
oars, while no one appeared to be steering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t enough that they must attempt an
impossibility!&rdquo; Tom Downey cried angrily.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re bent on doing all within their power to
provoke destruction. What kind of a sailor can
he be who believes it possible to put a craft of any
kind through the surf without a helmsman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one made reply to this outburst. The surfmen
on shore understood that even though the oncoming
craft had been a life-boat, it meant certain
disaster to handle her in such manner.</p>

<p>And that disaster came even sooner than they
expected.</p>

<p>Before the little craft had cleared more than a
third of the distance from the steamer to the shore,
she was overturned by a heavy breaker which raised
the stern higher and higher until the bow was forced
into the trough of the sea, and the boat disappeared
entirely.</p>

<p>As the waves rose the eight men could be seen
struggling amid the foaming waters, and this sight
caused the life savers to forget their previous failure&mdash;their
late struggle amid that same surf, wherein
death so nearly overtook them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys!&rdquo; Downey shouted, throwing
off his outer clothing as he ran swiftly to where the
surf-boat, having drifted ashore, was lying beyond
reach of the waves. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand here and see
them drown, however the disaster has been caused!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny ran with the crew, clutching at Sam
Hardy&rsquo;s garments as if begging him not to make
the venture which apparently meant positive death;
but yet daring to speak no word.</p>

<p>Once more they ran breast-deep into the water,
and, clambering over the gunwale as the surf-boat
was borne swiftly outward by the receding wave,
took up their oars. Again they battled against
wind and tide, heading straight onward to where
the seven struggling wretches could be seen&mdash;one
had already disappeared. Two of the steamer&rsquo;s
men were striking out for the shore, and appeared
to be making fair headway, while five others were
clustered near the capsized boat, apparently making
no decided effort to save themselves, except by
keeping their heads above water.</p>

<p>It seemed to Benny that the surf-boat must be
turned end over end before she was thirty yards
from the shore, in the same manner as during the
first attempt to put off; but Keeper Downey handled
her with consummate skill, and, owing to the
fact that the tide was ebbing, he succeeded in keeping
her on a comparatively even keel, avoiding
the two swimmers in order to direct his first efforts
toward those who appeared unable to help themselves.</p>

<p>The lad ashore followed with his eyes every
movement made by his comrades, literally ceasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
to breathe when the surf-boat was thrown high up
by the swell, and then panting heavily, as if sharing
in the exercise, when the crew strained every muscle
to force her over the next foaming wave.</p>

<p>Inch by inch, combating both wind and current,
their lives hanging in the balance when the little
craft was poised on the crest of some gigantic roller,
the brave life savers advanced until they had come
to the group of five who still paddled wildly around
the overturned boat.</p>

<p>This was a moment most fraught with peril, and
Benny clenched his hands until the nails almost cut
the flesh, so great was his suspense and fear, as one
after another of the men was hauled over the boat&rsquo;s
rail, saved, if the crew could gain the shore again.</p>

<p>The two who had been swimming were by this
time within the line of shore-breakers, moving
slowly as if nearly exhausted, and No. 8 saw his
opportunity of doing real life-saving work.</p>

<p>Seizing a coil of rope from the beach-wagon, he
ran with all speed to the very edge of the water,
when, standing motionless for an instant to make
certain of his aim, he flung one end out over the
waves.</p>

<p>Fortunately the wind forced the rope slightly
aside, otherwise it would have gone so far to windward
of the struggling men as to be of no avail.</p>

<p>As it was, however, this seeming accident was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the greatest possible advantage, since the coils
dropped almost directly upon the heads of the
struggling men, as fairly as Tom Downey or Sam
Hardy could have sent it.</p>

<p>Both the swimmers clutched it at the same instant,
and then it was Benny began to fear he had
attempted what it would be impossible to carry out.
His strength was not sufficient to enable him to
pull both the sailors in&mdash;in fact, a single man drawn
back by that undertow would have been too heavy
a burden for the lad&mdash;and while one might have
counted five he stood irresolute, trembling with
fear, for it seemed that he had begun the work only
to meet with failure.</p>

<p>Glancing quickly around as if hoping to see some
one who would lend assistance, his eyes rested upon
a spare tail-block in the beach-wagon, and now did
his experience on shipboard serve him in good
stead.</p>

<p>With the least possible delay he made this fast to
the wheel of the wagon in such fashion that the
drag would come upon the cart sideways, and, as
soon as might be, rove the casting-line through the
block.</p>

<p>Now he had a purchase which was equivalent to the
strength of three men when used on the rope without
a block, and he strained every muscle in this his
first attempt at life-saving, believing that unless he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
was successful the sailors would perish in the surf.
The strain forced the wheel of the wagon deep into
the pebbly beach, and, consequently, the purchase
held fast, while he, bracing himself against the
wheel, hauled and tugged until the skin on the
inner side of his fingers was broken in several places;
but he finally succeeded in the effort.</p>

<p>Lest it appear incredible that a lad only twelve
years of age should be able to perform such a feat,
let it be borne in mind that Benny knew full well
the value of such a purchase as was formed by the
tail-block, having learned this while on shipboard,
and that his excitement and desire to save life lent
him a certain fictitious strength, for positive it is on
that day Benny Foster, unaided, except by the rope
and block, saved two lives.</p>

<p>While the rescued men were so near inshore as to
be able to gain a footing, their hold upon the rope
prevented them from being carried back by the
undertow, giving them a means of standing steadily
when otherwise the surf would have swept them out
to sea again, and during the momentary lull both
succeeded in running beyond reach of the waters.</p>

<p>Then it was they fell on the shore as if dead;
but the lad who rescued them knew full well
they were only exhausted. Not until he was
assured of their safety, did Benny allow himself to
look seaward, and then his heart was filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
thankfulness, for the surf-boat laden gunwale deep
with her crew and those that had been snatched
from the raging waters, was coming like an arrow
toward the shore on the crest of a wave that had in
it such force as must land her beyond the reach of
danger.</p>

<p>Out of eight men who had tempted death in a
venture which was the height of foolhardiness, seven
were brought safely to land by the life-saving crew,
among whom should be numbered Benny Foster.</p>

<p>The lad only waited to assure himself that his
comrades were safe, when he turned his attention
to the men whom he had dragged ashore; but they
stood in little need of his services, for by this time
both were fully conscious, and before Benny could
so much as speak, Sam Hardy, having leaped out
of the boat, had caught the boy in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done that, No. 8, of which any one of
us might well be proud, and he who says you&rsquo;re
not a member of this crew, is makin&rsquo; the mistake of
his life! You were born to the work, my boy, and
have got the heart to carry it through!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So great had been the lad&rsquo;s excitement that he
was hardly aware of the service he had rendered,
until each of the men in turn had some word of
praise or congratulation to bestow, and not the least
was that which came from Tom Downey, who said
as he hurried on toward the gun:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get a medal for this morning&rsquo;s
work, No. 8, it&rsquo;s because we can&rsquo;t tell the story in
the proper way, for you&rsquo;ve earned one if ever man
did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No more than two or three minutes in all had
been spent by the life savers upon the lad, for each
had greeted him while pressing on to take his proper
station, and by the time Benny fully understood
what the keeper&rsquo;s words signified, every member of
the crew was performing the necessary work toward
sending out the breeches-buoy.</p>

<p>While the rescue was being effected the steamer
had been driven yet higher up on the shoal, and was
now so near the shore as to render it a comparatively
simple matter to send the line-carrying shot over her
deck.</p>

<p>Once communication was established Benny took
his station at the whip in the rear of the shifting-man,
hauling with a will, and heeding not the
laborious exertion until one after another, first the
passengers, then the crew, and lastly the captain
were brought ashore.</p>

<p>The master of the steamer made no verbal comment
upon the work when he clambered out from
the breeches-buoy.</p>

<p>He clasped Keeper Downey&rsquo;s hand for an instant,
looking into the latter&rsquo;s eyes as if acknowledging
his fault, and then turning to Benny, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
&ldquo;I saw what you did, lad, and the best man of
your crew couldn&rsquo;t have accomplished the rescue
more expeditiously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men whom the lad had saved now came
forward as if to give words to their thankfulness,
but Keeper Downey prevented any further conversation
by saying sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain, you will get your people together and
start them at once for the station. No. 8 will show
the way, and see to it that you are provided with
dry clothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked around as if asking who No. 8
might be, when Joe Cushing cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s that whifflet in front of you, captain. It
may seem strange that a lad of his size is a member
of a life-saving crew, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s true he don&rsquo;t figure
on the list; but all the same he has his place with
us, an&rsquo; always will till he himself shall want to leave
the service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny&rsquo;s face was crimsoned when he turned to
conduct the rescued party along the coast, and he
walked some distance in advance fearing lest further
praise might be bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Before having gone a dozen yards he heard Tom
Downey say to the cook:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow on, my man, for the chances are those
people will need something warm; but you&rsquo;ll remember
that No. 8 is in charge until I get back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the height of honor, so Benny believed,
and he no longer thought of the medal which might
possibly be his, because of the fact that the keeper
had shown most conclusively that he was a member
of the crew of equal standing with the others.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">&ldquo;NUMBER EIGHT.&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>Although he had remained on duty since the previous
afternoon, and, counting the time spent in the
city with Sam Hardy, had been without rest full
forty-four hours, Benny insisted on doing his equal
share of work in the kitchen when the crew and
passengers of the stranded steamer arrived at the
station.</p>

<p>It was so late in the day, and the crew yet had so
much labor to perform, that there would not be
time in which to make the necessary arrangements
for sending into town until the following day those
who had been rescued from the steamer, therefore
the station was a scene of bustling activity.</p>

<p>The officers and crew of the steamer were to be
given a hearty meal before they joined the life-saving
crew in patrolling the shore on the lookout
for such wreckage as might be driven in from their
craft, and after that had been done the passengers
must be cared for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
&ldquo;With the addition to our family of thirty-eight,
work here in the station will be right lively,&rdquo; the
cook said to Benny when the latter, after providing
with dry clothing such of the rescued as were in
need, presented himself in the kitchen; &ldquo;but for all
that I can run the concern without calling on a boy
who hasn&rsquo;t been in bed since night before last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more tired than any other member of
the crew, and want to do my share,&rdquo; Benny insisted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a pretty poor No. 8 if I couldn&rsquo;t
hold my own with those who have done twice as
much work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve kept even pace with all hands, accordin&rsquo;
to what I&rsquo;ve heard, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll please me better
to see you in the other room taking care of Fluff C.
Foster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t need me while all those ladies are petting
him. Of course he was glad to see me after
being alone in the station so long; but while I was
getting out the dry clothing he made friends with
some of the passengers, and now hasn&rsquo;t time to
more than look at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he got his medal on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d let him wear that all the
time?&rdquo; and Benny set about paring potatoes as if
he had but just come on duty. &ldquo;I took it off the
very minute we got back from the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to let him have it, for surely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
people will be interested in knowing he has won
such an honor. There ain&rsquo;t many dogs who can
show as much, an&rsquo; it isn&rsquo;t fair to keep it from him
just now. You must go back and tell the whole
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny hesitated. He was eager that Fluff should
have all the credit due him, but feared lest by displaying
the medal his motives might be misunderstood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they&rsquo;d think I was trying to
make out he was something wonderful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be too modest, Benjamin. Fluff
really was the means of saving Mr. Bradford&rsquo;s life,
and it&rsquo;s only fair to let people know about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus urged, Benny did as the cook desired, and
nearly half an hour elapsed before he returned to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed as if I&rsquo;d never get away,&rdquo; he said
apologetically, taking up the first work which presented
itself, and quickening his movements to atone
for lost time. &ldquo;They made me tell the story over
and over again, and now Fluff&rsquo;s having a terrible
good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it should be, and I only wish they&rsquo;d
kept you longer, for I don&rsquo;t like to see a tired lad
hustling around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt myself,&rdquo; Benny replied with a
laugh, determined not to be prevented from attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to his regular duties, except by a positive command
from Keeper Downey.</p>

<p>The members of the crew were too busy to give
much heed to No. 8. The tugs, which had finally
come in response to the messages sent, were lying-to
outside, communicating with the keeper by
signals; all the gear used was to be put away in
proper order that it might be got at without loss of
time should occasion arise, and three of the men
had been sent back on the bluff to watch for wreckage
from the steamer. In fact, all was bustle and
seeming confusion until after the keeper issued imperative
orders that Benny make up a bed for himself
in the kitchen, and go to sleep.</p>

<p>The number of the rescued was so large that all
the apartments in the station, save the kitchen
itself, were given up to them, the crew lying down
when their turns to rest came, wherever sufficient
space could be found.</p>

<p>Regardless of the noise consequent upon so many
people being crowded into such small quarters,
Benny slept as only a tired boy can, until the cook
aroused him by building the fire next morning in
order to cook breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he said in reply to
the question as to his condition; &ldquo;but I must have
been terrible sleepy last night, for I&rsquo;ve let Fluff
wear his collar and medal all night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do any harm, and, besides, he&rsquo;s
bound to keep his ornaments on till our visitors
leave. I reckon we&rsquo;ll soon have the station to ourselves,
an&rsquo; I for one won&rsquo;t be sorry. This sleepin&rsquo;
on the kitchen floor with not so much as a blanket
to ease up on the boards, ain&rsquo;t particularly pleasant,
accordin&rsquo; to the way I look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have slept on a rock last night, I was
so tired,&rdquo; Benny replied, with a cheerful laugh as
he began his toilet, promising Fluff that he should
have his hair combed before the ladies appeared.
&ldquo;How are they going away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was settled last night, over the telephone,
that if the wind died down, a tug would be out
here about eight o&rsquo;clock, and it&rsquo;s so calm now
that there won&rsquo;t be any trouble in putting them
aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the steamer was stove to pieces?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Cushing was the last man in, and he reported
that she was then in fair condition for hauling
off. The wrecking crews will soon be at work,
and if the weather holds good it may be possible to
save her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will our crew be called upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. All that is done by contract,
and those who take the job have no right to ask for
the services of the life-saving men. Why don&rsquo;t you
take a spin out there, an&rsquo; see how she looks?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;ll be more to my credit if I stay here
pretty close while there&rsquo;s so much work to be
done,&rdquo; Benny replied with a laugh, and then, his
own toilet having been made, he set about combing
Fluff, an operation which was never greatly enjoyed
by the dog.</p>

<p>While No. 8 was busily engaged in helping the
cook, several of the lady passengers from the steamer
held a private interview with Keeper Downey, and
it seemed as if they had no slight amount of business
to settle, for not until breakfast had been
served did the conference come to an end.</p>

<p>Before the meal was finished a tug hove to off the
cove, and Sam Hardy announced that the passengers
from the stranded steamer could be put on board
whenever they were ready to leave.</p>

<p>Before taking their departure every woman and
man shook hands most cordially with Benny, and
one of the ladies whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not refuse to accept what has been
left for you and Fluff. Each of us considered it a
favor to be allowed to add something, and when
your school days begin it will be needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was wholly at a loss to understand the
meaning of these words, and when he asked Sam
Hardy if he knew to what the lady referred, that
jolly surfman said with a laugh:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out in time, No. 8, and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
worth your while to look at Article 151 of the <i class="cite">Revised
Regulations</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny waited until all those who were to be taken
to the city had been put on board the tug, for none
but the passengers were to leave the vicinity, the crew
and officers of the steamer remaining to assist in the
labor of floating the steamer, and then he set about
finding the article to which Sam Hardy referred.</p>

<p>Twice over he read the following lines, and even
then he was puzzled to understand what bearing
they could have upon the remark made by the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The regular crews of stations are not entitled to
salvage, it being part of their duty, as Government
employees, to assist, without charge, in saving
property from wrecked vessels, so far as it can be
done without interfering with the duty of saving
life, which must always be the paramount consideration,
or injuring the effectiveness of the appliances
for prompt service at any moment. They are not,
however, prohibited from claiming reasonable compensation
for the use of boats, wagons, or other
appliances, personally belonging to them, which
may be employed upon such occasions, nor from
receiving such rewards for labor performed, or risk
incurred at wrecks, as owners or masters of vessels
or other persons may see fit to <i>voluntarily</i> bestow
upon them, but they are strictly forbidden to solicit
such rewards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crew of the station had not been served with
breakfast before the departure of the tug, owing to
lack of space for so many in the mess-room, therefore
they were alone once more when the cook summoned
them to the long-delayed meal.</p>

<p>As he took his seat at the table, Benny fancied
his comrades looked unusually sharp at him; but no
one made any comment, until the hunger of all had
been satisfied, when Keeper Downey asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see one of the ladies whispering to
you just before the passengers went on board the
tug?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Benny replied, and then he repeated
what she had said, together with the conversation
between himself and Sam Hardy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did you look up Article 151?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but I couldn&rsquo;t find out anything by
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain it, No. 8, and while I&rsquo;m doing so
remember that I&rsquo;m the captain of this crew, and
my orders are to be obeyed without question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Benny said hesitatingly, almost
alarmed by this stern reminder of authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the passengers heard what Fluff had done,
they were naturally curious to know why a lad like
you was living in such a place, and it became necessary
to tell the story. You can hardly wonder that
every one of them was eager to show due appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
of our services, and it was decided among them
that it could best be done by making some little
provision for the future of you and Fluff C. Foster,
although all knew you belong to us, if it so chances
that no relatives come forward to claim you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any relatives, except it might be
second-hand ones who never so much as heard of
me,&rdquo; Benny interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can almost hope you haven&rsquo;t, No. 8, for
we couldn&rsquo;t afford to spare you from this &rsquo;ere
crew,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said emphatically, and Tom
Downey motioned that all remain silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The passengers made up a purse for the lad
who, unaided, saved the lives of two men, and in
Article 151 you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;re allowed to receive
whatever may be given you voluntarily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that they&rsquo;ve paid me money?&rdquo;
Benny asked sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it was with the full approval of every
member of this crew, except yourself. By making
up a purse for you and Fluff, a great compliment
was paid to us, and as such you must receive it
without any back talk. I&rsquo;ve got here one hundred
and thirty dollars, which is to be put into the bank
for your benefit, and as the lady said, it will come
in handy when you begin to go to school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Downey displayed the money, but Benny
made no attempt to touch it, and Sam Hardy took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
it upon himself to banish the lad&rsquo;s scruples in regard
to receiving it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a man among us who would refuse
a gift made in the same spirit that was, No. 8, an&rsquo;
we take it as a compliment to ourselves. It would
have pleased us better if the passengers themselves
could have put the money in your hands; but we
felt afraid you&rsquo;d be so backward about acceptin&rsquo; it
as to give them the idea such a token wasn&rsquo;t to
your likin&rsquo;, so the keeper took the matter in charge.
We want you to be glad, for the rest of us are feelin&rsquo;
mighty fine because it has been done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny could make no reply just then, and his
comrades understood the reason; but later he came
to look at the matter in a different light, and asked
Tom Downey to write a letter thanking the passengers
for their kindness.</p>

<p>The crew had but little time to spend on private
affairs just at this moment. The wrecking crew
went to work on the stranded steamer that same
day, and all hands were interested in watching the
operations, which were not brought to an end for
many days, when the vessel was hauled off the
shoal with no more damage than might have been
expected.</p>

<p>Some time before the work came to an end the
life-saving crew settled down once more to the
regular routine of duty, and Sam Hardy suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
that No. 8 spend all his spare time studying the
printed rules for the management of open row-boats
in a surf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what every lad should know, Benjamin,
whether he counts on becoming a surfman or not,
and you must have it all well in mind before spring,
when I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give you plenty of practice in
such work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under this inducement it is not to be wondered
at that Benny at once became unusually studious,
and on the day before his uniform arrived, it was
possible for him to repeat all which is here set down
for the benefit of those lads who may not have such
an able teacher as Sam Hardy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a general rule, speed must be given to a
boat rowing against a heavy surf. Indeed, under
some circumstances, her safety will depend on the
utmost possible speed being attained on meeting a
sea. For if the sea be really heavy, and the wind
blowing a hard on-shore gale, it can only be by the
utmost exertions of the crew that any headway can
be made. The great danger then is, that an approaching
heavy sea may carry the boat away on its
front, and turn it broadside on, or up-end it, either
effect being immediately fatal. A boat&rsquo;s only
chance in such a case is to obtain such way as shall
enable her to pass, end on, through the crest of the
sea, and leave it as soon as possible behind her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Of course, if there be a rather heavy surf, but no
wind, or the wind off shore, and opposed to the surf,
as is often the case, a boat might be propelled so
rapidly through it that her bow would fall more
suddenly and heavily after topping the sea than if
her way had been checked; and it may, therefore,
only be when the sea is of such magnitude, and the
boat of such a character, that there may be a chance
of the former carrying her back before it, that full
speed should be given her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may also happen that, by careful management
under such circumstances, a boat may be made to
avoid the sea, so that each wave may break ahead
of her, which may be the only chance of safety in a
small boat; but if the shore be flat, and the broken
water extends to a great distance from it, this will
often be impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If sufficient command can be kept over a boat
by the skill of those on board her, avoid or &lsquo;dodge&rsquo;
the sea, if possible, so as not to meet it at the moment
of its breaking or curling over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against a head gale and heavy surf, get all possible
speed on a boat on the approach of every sea
which cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If more speed can be given to a boat than is
sufficient to prevent her being carried back by the
surf, her way may be checked on its approach,
which will give her an easier passage over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
&ldquo;The one great danger, when running before a
broken sea, is that of broaching-to. To that peculiar
effect of the sea, so frequently destructive of
human life, the utmost attention must be directed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cause of a boat&rsquo;s broaching-to when running
before a broken sea or surf is, that her own motion
being in the same direction as that of the sea,
whether it be given by the force of oars or sails, or
by the force of the sea itself, she opposes no resistance
to it, but is carried before it. Thus, if a boat
be running with her bow to the shore and her stern
to the sea, the first effect of the surf or roller, on its
overtaking her, is to throw up the stern, and as a
consequence to depress the bow; if she then has
sufficient inertia (which will be proportional to
weight) to allow the sea to pass her, she will in succession
pass through the descending, the horizontal,
and the ascending positions, as the crest of the wave
passes successively her stern, her midships, and
her bow, in the reverse order in which the same
positions occur to a boat propelled to seaward
against a surf. This may be defined as the safe
mode of running before a broken sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if a boat, on being overtaken by a heavy
surf, has not sufficient inertia to allow it to pass
her, the first of the three positions above enumerated
alone occurs; her stern is raised high in the air, and
the wave carries the boat before it, on its front or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
unsafe side, sometimes with frightful velocity, the
bow all the time deeply immersed in the hollow of
the sea, where the water, stationary or comparatively
so, offers a resistance, whilst the crest of the
sea, having the actual motion which causes it to
break, forces onward the stern or rear end of the
boat. A boat will, in this position sometimes, aided
by careful oar-steerage, run a considerable distance
until the wave has broken and expended itself. But
it will often happen that if the bow be low it will be
driven under water, when, the buoyancy being lost
forward, whilst the sea presses on the stern, the boat
will be thrown (as it is termed) end over end; or, if
the bow be high, or it be protected, as in most lifeboats,
by a bow air-chamber, so that it does not become
submerged, that the resistance forward, acting
on one bow, will slightly turn the boat&rsquo;s head, and
the force of the surf being transferred to the opposite
quarter, she will in a moment be turned round broadside
by the sea, and be thrown by it on her beam ends
or altogether capsized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hence, it follows, that the management of a
boat, when landing through a heavy surf, must, as
far as possible, be assimilated to that when proceeding
to seaward against one, at least so far as to stop
her progress shoreward at the moment of being overtaken
by a heavy sea, and thus enabling it to pass
her. There are different ways of effecting this object:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
&ldquo;1. By turning a boat&rsquo;s head to the sea before
entering the broken water, and then backing in
stern foremost, pulling a few strokes ahead to meet
each heavy sea, and then again backing astern. If
the sea be really heavy and a boat small, this plan
will generally be the safest, as a boat cannot be
kept more under command when the full force of
the oars can be used against a heavy surf than by
backing them only.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. If rowing to shore with the stern to seaward,
by backing all the oars on the approach of a heavy
sea, and rowing ahead again as soon as it has passed
to the bow of the boat, thus rowing it on the back
of the wave; or, as is practiced in some life-boats,
placing the after-oarsmen with their faces forward
and making them row back at each sea on its approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. If rowed in bow foremost, by towing astern
a pig of ballast or large stone, or a large basket, or
canvas bag, termed a &lsquo;drogue&rsquo; or drag, made for
the purpose, the object of each being to hold the
boat&rsquo;s stern back, and prevent her being turned
broadside to the sea or broaching-to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavy weights should be kept out of the extreme
ends of a boat; but when rowing before a
heavy sea the best trim is deepest by the stern,
which prevents the stern being readily thrown on
one side by the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
&ldquo;The following general rules may therefore be
depended on when running before, or attempting to
land, through a heavy surf or broken water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;1. As far as possible, avoid each sea by placing
the boat where the sea will break ahead or astern of
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. If the sea be very heavy, or if the boat be
very small, and especially if she have a square stern,
bring her bow round to seaward and back her in,
rowing ahead against each heavy surf that cannot
be avoided sufficiently to allow it to pass the boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. If it be considered safe to proceed to the
shore bow foremost, back the oars against each sea
on its approach, so as to stop the boat&rsquo;s way through
the water as far as possible, and if there is a drogue,
or any other instrument in the boat which may be
used as one, tow it astern to aid in keeping the boat
end on to the sea, which is the chief object in view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4. Bring the principal weights in the boat
towards the end that is to seaward, but not to the
extreme end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of these rules Benny was called upon to repeat
aloud before the entire crew, and in the discussion
which followed he learned very much which would
be valuable when the time came that he could put
the teaching into practice; but all his comrades
assured him that if he would keep this one lesson
well in mind, he might be depended upon to manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
a boat in broken water without first having had
any experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad when I can handle the surf-boat,&rdquo;
he said as he took Fluff in his arms preparatory to
going to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will come in good time, lad, never fear,&rdquo;
Keeper Downey said cheerily; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll be
called upon to wait patiently until warmer weather
is here. In the meantime we&rsquo;ve something important
on hand to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny looked at him questioningly, and the
keeper asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten that the uniform should be
done by this time, and to-morrow&rsquo;s my day for
going into the city?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t forget it, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why hadn&rsquo;t you spoken about it?&rdquo; Joe
Cushing asked impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid perhaps Mr. Downey had changed
his mind about going to the city, and besides I
didn&rsquo;t want you to think I couldn&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little fear of your being too forward,
my lad,&rdquo; Sam Hardy said with a hearty laugh.
&ldquo;We must see to it that you&rsquo;re called regularly
to meals, or you&rsquo;ll get the idea that perhaps we&rsquo;d
like it better if you missed one or two. The uniform
is to be here to-morrow, an&rsquo; if anything had
prevented the keeper from going to town, I&rsquo;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
pulled in and back myself, for I&rsquo;m mighty anxious
to see you togged out in proper fashion, even if you
do feel so moderate about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I want the uniform,&rdquo; Benny added
quickly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rather wait a week than have
any of the crew put themselves out to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the lad, holding the dog affectionately in
his arms, ascended the stairs to the sleeping quarters,
and when he had disappeared from view, Sam Hardy
said emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordin&rsquo; to my way of thinkin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s seldom
you run across so good a lad as No. 8.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; Mr. Downey added.
&ldquo;All that troubles me in the matter is the fear that
we may not be doing quite our duty by the boy in
keeping him here with us, when he should be at
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that fret you; he&rsquo;ll learn enough
wherever he is, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a heap of satisfaction to the
little shaver when he believes he&rsquo;s paying his own
way,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said quickly, and Dick Sawyer
cried emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t do all of that, then I&rsquo;d like to see
the boy, or man either for that matter, who does!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WRECKERS.</span></h2>

<p>The crew at the station were, even under ordinary
circumstances, out of bed early in the morning; but
since the wreckers had been at work on the stranded
steamer there was little possibility any one, except a
very deaf person, could sleep after the first signs of
day appeared in the sky.</p>

<p>The wrecking tugs, when they did not return to
the city at nightfall, anchored off the cove near the
station, and their whistles were sounded vigorously
fully half an hour before daybreak, in order that
the men might be ready for work as soon as there
was sufficient light.</p>

<p>As Sam Hardy said, &ldquo;it came pretty rough on a
fellow who&rsquo;d been patrolling the coast till midnight,
to be wakened at four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; but grumbling
on the part of the life savers effected no change
in the situation, and as a rule breakfast had been
eaten before the man whose tour of duty ended
only at daylight, had returned to the station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
On this morning when Tom Downey was to visit
the city, all hands had been awakened even earlier
than usual, and the keeper set off a full hour before
Joe Cushing, who had the last trick at patrolling,
came into the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like to be a long day for us, lad,&rdquo; Sam
Hardy said as he entered the kitchen where Benny
was washing the breakfast dishes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;
you can&rsquo;t be so very busy &rsquo;twixt now an&rsquo; eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done around the house,
so I counted on studying the <i class="cite">Regulations</i> for a
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do you any harm to drop that kind of
work for a spell; you already know more of that
precious book than any of us, except it may be Tom
Downey, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s danger you&rsquo;ll grow too wise
in the work of life-saving. What do you say to
havin&rsquo; a look at the wreckers? They are gettin&rsquo;
well along with their job, an&rsquo; I allow the tugs will
make a try at pullin&rsquo; the steamer off when this tide
rises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go if it would be all right to leave,&rdquo;
Benny said thoughtfully, as he looked inquiringly
at the cook, and the latter replied to the unspoken
question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t have an
outin&rsquo;, lad. It&rsquo;ll do you solid good, for you&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
been shut up here too long. What about Fluff C.
Foster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to take him with me, for it&rsquo;s
too cold on the rocks, and where there are so many
men at work he might get hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, leave him behind, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll answer
for it that he comes to no harm. Maje has given
over all ideas of botherin&rsquo; him, and, besides, if you
say the word, he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be allowed to poke his pink
nose out of doors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny put on the pea-jacket which was large
enough to serve him as an overcoat, pulled the flaps
of the sou&rsquo;-wester over his ears, and, just as the sun
was coming up from behind the restless expanse of
water, the two set out, walking at full speed, for
the cold was too intense to admit of any pleasant
lingering by the way.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the scene of the wrecking
operations it appeared very much to No. 8 as if Joe
Cushing had made a mistake when he declared that
the steamer might be saved. To the lad she looked
like a hopeless wreck.</p>

<p>The sea had thrown her on her beam ends, and
then forced her so high up on the shoal that nearly
half the bottom was exposed to view. The bridge,
a greater portion of both rails, and nearly everything
on deck was missing, while the wreckage along
shore explained where the top-hammer had gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
&ldquo;Been used rather rough, eh?&rdquo; Hardy said as
he and Benny stood on the cliff where a full view of
the wreck could be had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that they can get her
off, or, even if that might be done, that she would
be fit for sea again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a mishap like this the worst of the mischief
is all on the outside, lad. Most likely her hull is as
sound as ever, and it only remains to get her afloat,
when a little carpenter-work will finish the job.
It&rsquo;s a pity the steamers couldn&rsquo;t go alongside, for
then she might be raised in short order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wrecking tugs were lying some distance off
shore, and lighters had been drifted down over the
shoal to the steamer&rsquo;s side. A large number of men
were at work making ready to break the cargo;
others were running out anchors to prevent her
being driven any further ashore, and yet another
crew was gathering up the odds and ends which had
been driven ashore.</p>

<p>Half a dozen small boats were moving back and
forth from the steamer to the shore, and after surveying
the scene from the cliff until the chilling
wind suggested a retreat, Sam Hardy said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to go on board, lad.
What do you say to looking the old hooker over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll allow us on her, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon there won&rsquo;t be any great row about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
lad. After what our crew, an&rsquo; especially you, have
done, it would be odd if we should be warned to
keep off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was eager for a nearer view of the steamer,
and Sam led the way down to the narrow beach
where so much of heroism had been displayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, mates, will you take us off to the
wreck?&rdquo; Sam cried to four men who were launching
a surf-boat bearing the name of a well-known
wrecking tug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we will, although I should think you
might have seen enough already of yonder steamer,&rdquo;
one of the party replied cheerily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had too big a job on our hands to spend
very much time in looking her over; but it&rsquo;s possible
to take things easier this morning, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d like
to see how badly she&rsquo;s been punished,&rdquo; Sam replied
as he and Benny stood by to take their places in
the boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t in bad shape, an&rsquo; if the weather holds
good we&rsquo;ll soon have her afloat,&rdquo; he who was in
charge of the boat said in a matter-of-fact tone, and
after they had put off he asked, nodding toward
Benny:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that lad a member of the crew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that he is, an&rsquo; one who don&rsquo;t spend much
idle time when we&rsquo;re pushed, as was the case when
this steamer came ashore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the boy who hauled the two sailors
out of the water? The steamer&rsquo;s captain was tellin&rsquo;
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the same identical lad,&rdquo; Sam replied
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That little shaver couldn&rsquo;t haul his own weight
through such a surf as was runnin&rsquo; when yonder
craft struck the shoal,&rdquo; the man replied decidedly,
giving no more than a passing glance at Benny,
who looked even smaller than ever beneath the
huge pea-jacket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he did, matey, an,&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, set about
it in sailor-like fashion, finishin&rsquo; the job as quickly
as you or I could have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sam went into the details of the rescue
effected by Benny, while the lad kept his face
turned seaward lest the men should see and laugh
at his blushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that beats me!&rdquo; the sailor at the helm
cried when Sam&rsquo;s story was come to an end. &ldquo;A
lad who can do such a trick as that while everything
is in confusion, as it must have been then, has good
stuff in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he has,&rdquo; Sam replied proudly,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; we put on a good many airs because he belongs
to our crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this moment Benny received far more attention
than was altogether agreeable to him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
crew of the surf-boat told those on board the
steamer that he was the lad who had displayed so
much bravery and sound common-sense when
human lives were in danger, and every man seemed
eager to give him some word of praise, until the
boy was so uncomfortable in mind that he wished
heartily he had never been tempted to visit the
wreck.</p>

<p>The workmen had more important matters to occupy
their attention, however, and after devoting a
few moments to No. 8 they left him alone with Sam
Hardy, who said with a hearty laugh:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a big reputation for yourself, lad,
and this summer, when visitors come out to the
station, as they do nearly every pleasant day, we&rsquo;ll
be obliged to trot you and Fluff C. Foster out on
parade as our swell life savers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t want to stay there. I wouldn&rsquo;t
have come over here if I&rsquo;d known the men would
say so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, surely, you&rsquo;re not ashamed of yesterday&rsquo;s
work, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not because I helped the men ashore; but it
makes me feel mean to hear people praising me for
doing what any other fellow would have done. It
must be a pretty poor kind of a boy who couldn&rsquo;t
throw a rope out to a drowning man, and I&rsquo;d
missed both of them if the wind hadn&rsquo;t sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
coils in a different direction from which I was aiming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Benjamin, allow it all to be as you&rsquo;ve
said, you&rsquo;ll have to put up with some praise for a
spell, an&rsquo; then folks will forget it, for in this world
a fellow can&rsquo;t live very long on what he&rsquo;s done in
the past. They&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; off the hatches now, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m minded to have a look at the hold of this &rsquo;ere
craft. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny followed, but there was to him nothing
particularly interesting in the cargo, and as it could
not be seen from the deck, he left Sam and went
aft, where he might watch the movements of the
tugs as they pulled the lighters here and there in
such position that the wind and current would send
them down over the shoal to the wreck.</p>

<p>This last portion of the work soon engrossed the
attention of all the wrecking crew, including those
who had been making an examination of the steamer&rsquo;s
hold, for considerable difficulty was experienced
in moving the heavy lighters to and fro, and after a
time Benny realized that he and Sam were the only
ones left aboard the steamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be obliged to stay here till one of the
boats is alongside,&rdquo; he said to himself, and then
came the thought that he was spending too much
time in pleasuring when he should be attending to
his regular duties in the station kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Hardy will be ready to go now,&rdquo;
he said, running forward toward the hatch where
the surfman had last been seen.</p>

<p>The decks were deserted, and he saw no signs of
life on the ship. It was as if he had been abandoned,
and but for the many craft near at hand he
might have had a very disagreeable sensation of
utter loneliness. As a matter of fact, something
much like a shudder of fear came over him with the
first knowledge that he was alone; but he forced it
back with a laugh as he said aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If people could know that I&rsquo;m almost afraid of
being here, even though there are an hundred men
within hail, I wouldn&rsquo;t need to bother my head
about being called a hero when I don&rsquo;t deserve the
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking an odd, indistinct murmur
came from the dark hold, causing him to step back
toward the rail quickly; but he advanced again an
instant later, angry with himself for being such a
coward.</p>

<p>Once more came that strange noise; but, half-expecting
it, Benny held his ground, determined to
learn the cause, since, until Sam Hardy should return,
he had nothing better with which to occupy
himself.</p>

<p>Leaning over the hatch he peered down into the
darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
The space between decks was apparently empty,
and he heard the water gurgling far below in the
lower hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must be what I heard,&rdquo; he said, speaking
aloud, and the words had no more than been uttered
when it seemed as if amid the gurgling noise he
could distinguish his own name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; he cried, smiling to think he should
be so foolish as to answer the water; but an instant
later his face grew pale as he heard plainly the
words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benny! Benny Foster!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was but one in the vicinity who would thus
address him, and although it seemed impossible
Sam Hardy could be in that apparently empty hold,
he leaned far over as he shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Hardy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad, come quick! I can&rsquo;t hold out much
longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Benny was alarmed, and with good cause.</p>

<p>Leading down to the second deck was a single
stanchion; the ladder had been torn or carried
away. Heeled over as the steamer was, this timber
stood at an inclination of forty-five degrees, and
at its foot the deck had about the same inclination
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Benny waited only so long as was necessary in
order to throw off his pea-jacket, and then slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
down the stanchion, holding hard on reaching the
deck below lest he should slide to port.</p>

<p>Here all was darkness, save for the square of gray
light that marked the location of the hatch, and
the lad tried in vain to pierce it with his eyes in
search for the surfman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you, Mr. Hardy?&rdquo; he cried falteringly.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanging by a rope below the second hatchway.
It swings so far to port that I can&rsquo;t pull myself up,
and I don&rsquo;t dare to drop for fear the distance may
be too great. Lean over and try to get hold of me,
lad; I only need a little aid, for it is possible to
help myself a good bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it was only necessary Benny should feel
along the upper side of the hatchway in order to
find the rope by which the surfman was suspended,
and the first thought was that he could readily pull
his comrade up.</p>

<p>With the deck at such an inclination he could get
no secure foothold, and the first attempt was sufficient
to show him that the task was beyond his strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you wait till I go on the upper deck?&rdquo; he
asked anxiously. &ldquo;There are plenty of men close
by; but all hands have left the steamer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, lad, but move quickly. I&rsquo;ve hung
here until it seems as if my arms were pulled out of
their sockets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny sought the stanchion by which he had descended,
and, gaining it, soon understood that he
could no more work his way unaided to the top than
Hardy could swarm up the rope while it swung so
far away from the side of the vessel.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if he had spent many minutes
in the vain task, when in reality no more than a
dozen seconds had been sufficient in which to prove
that it was useless, and then he allowed himself to
fall back again toward where the rope was made fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get up,&rdquo; he cried in a tearful voice.
&ldquo;Suppose I lean way over the hatch till you can
get hold of my arms? The two of us should be
able to work it in that fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d pull you down, lad; there&rsquo;s no use in trying
anything like that. If it&rsquo;s certain you can&rsquo;t
get on deck, I&rsquo;ll take the chances of what may be
below, an&rsquo; drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it! Don&rsquo;t do it! Let me try just
once!&rdquo; and without waiting for a reply Benny bent
far over the combing of the hatch, twining his legs
around the stanchion.</p>

<p>By letting himself down nearly at full length he
found to his great joy that he could touch the surfman&rsquo;s
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll get hold, and you shall put your arms
around my neck,&rdquo; he cried as if asking some great
favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try it, lad, for I&rsquo;ll surely drag you down.
It may be that I can drop without much hurt, and
even a broken bone to one, is better than for us to
fall together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try it!&rdquo; Benny screamed, seizing Sam by the
neck. &ldquo;Get hold of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surfman had no alternative, unless the boy
should loosen his hold, and, letting go of the rope
with one hand, he clasped the other around Benny&rsquo;s
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now get hold with the other, and then shin up!
I can hold on here quite a spell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even now the heavy strain was beginning to tell
upon the lad, and Sam understood that if anything
was to be accomplished it must be done in the
shortest possible space of time.</p>

<p>Wearied though he was by his previous vain exertions,
he put forth all his strength for the last effort,
and in so doing knew full well he inflicted grievous
pain upon the little fellow who was ready to take
any chances in order to aid him.</p>

<p>With a firm hold of Benny&rsquo;s body the surfman
was enabled to climb upward, and in a few seconds,
which must have seemed to the boy like ten times
that number of minutes, he succeeded in clutching
the combing of the hatch.</p>

<p>Dragging himself over he seized No. 8&rsquo;s legs, and
none too soon, for the boy&rsquo;s strength was exhausted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
and at the very instant Sam grasped him he was
forced to let go his hold.</p>

<p>A moment later the two were lying along the side
of the hatch panting for breath, but in no further
danger of a fall, and some time elapsed before the
silence was broken.</p>

<p>Then Sam said, groping about in the darkness for
Benny&rsquo;s hands, and holding them firmly as he spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be, lad, that I made all that trouble for
nothing. It is possible the cargo was within a few
inches of my feet as I hung on the rope; but that I
couldn&rsquo;t know, and it was the fear of shattering a
bone which caused me to hold on and yell for help.
A surfman with a broken leg might lose a whole
season&rsquo;s work, seein&rsquo; &rsquo;s the damage wouldn&rsquo;t have
been done in line of duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I heard you. If all hands hadn&rsquo;t
left the steamer, perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have tried to
find out where you had gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, lad, that you did a brave thing
in takin&rsquo; the chances of my pullin&rsquo; you into the
hold with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t make such talk, Mr.
Hardy,&rdquo; Benny cried pleadingly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t brave,
for I was terribly frightened when that queer noise
came out of the hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I noticed that you kept on trying to find out
what it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, because I&rsquo;d been ashamed to have it
said I was scared at a noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hark you, Benny, I won&rsquo;t say anything
more about your being a little hero, although I may
think so just the same, and in return you shall keep
quiet about this bit of trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want any one to know of it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t, No. 8. It wouldn&rsquo;t sound
very well if you should tell that an old hand like
Sam Hardy let himself into the hold of a wreck by
a rope which he couldn&rsquo;t come back on. The boys
never&rsquo;d stop making fun of me, an&rsquo; more especially
if it turns out that I was hangin&rsquo; all that time within
two or three feet of the cargo. Now, is it a bargain
that both of us are to keep this &rsquo;ere business a profound
secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tell, sir, though I can&rsquo;t see that you
have anything to be ashamed of, for nobody would
want to take such chances as might have come. But
how are we going to get out? While the steamer is
heeled over so badly I can&rsquo;t climb up the stanchion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hold on a spell, till you&rsquo;re rested, and
then I can give you a lift up on my shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to try now, sir. I wasn&rsquo;t very
tired&mdash;only for a minute or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lad after my own heart, Benjamin, an&rsquo; so
long as I have a dollar or a shelter, half of it belongs
to you! Now then, get up on my shoulder, an&rsquo; once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
we&rsquo;re on deck it&rsquo;s the same as if this foolish thing
never happened, except when we two are alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny scrambled up as Sam had directed, and
then the surfman, cautioning him to keep his knees
stiff, lifted the lad straight above his head until he
could seize the hatch-combing.</p>

<p>Once on deck he let down a length of rope, and
Sam Hardy was soon released from his temporary
prison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d better get back to the station
right away, or I&rsquo;ll be getting into more mischief,
like some youngster,&rdquo; the surfman said grimly as he
shouted to the crew of a small boat at hand to take
him ashore.</p>

<p>The captain of one of the wrecking tugs came
alongside at this moment, and, seeing Sam, cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, Hardy. I&rsquo;m going to
have a look at the cargo, and you&rsquo;d better go with
me. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to find out how well it
was stowed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what she&rsquo;s loaded with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pig-iron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t interest me to see it, and, besides, I&rsquo;ve
been down in the hold quite a spell already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are things there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t see very much; I
had business of my own before I&rsquo;d been there
many minutes. You&rsquo;ll need a lantern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sam went over the rail into the boat which
had come alongside to take him off, Benny following
close behind as a matter of course, and when the
two were on shore again the surfman said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been odd if I&rsquo;d dropped onto
that metal without doing myself some serious injury.
There&rsquo;s no longer any question, lad, but
that you pulled me out of a bad place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; Benny replied emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordin&rsquo; to my way of thinkin&rsquo; there&rsquo;d be
more reason for gladness if I had never been such a
bloomin&rsquo; idiot as to go down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so, sir; but, so long as you did, I&rsquo;m glad
I was the one who pulled you out, for it&rsquo;s likely to be
the only chance I&rsquo;ll ever have of doing you a favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain of that, No. 8, if you stay
around the station as long as we&rsquo;ll be glad to have
you. In this life of ours there are many times when
a fellow&rsquo;s mate can do very much toward savin&rsquo; his
life, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re just the kind of a comrade who can
be depended upon to do pretty near the right thing
at the right time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never since the morning when he first found himself
in the life-saving station had Benny felt so
proud and happy as at this moment, and he walked
by Sam Hardy&rsquo;s side unable to speak because of the
great joy in his heart.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">LIVELY WORK.</span></h2>

<p>When Sam Hardy and Benny returned to the life-saving
station no mention was made regarding the
misadventure on board the wreck, although the
former described in detail to his comrades all he had
seen on or around the steamer.</p>

<p>Benny&rsquo;s greatest fear was lest the cook might
question him so closely that it would become necessary
to remain silent or betray the secret, and
then the crew would understand that the two had
had some unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, all hands applied to Sam
for information, and he was able to lead the conversation
into some other channel whenever anything
was said regarding the hold of the steamer.</p>

<p>Then some sailors from one of the tugs came into
the station, and the crew no longer showed any desire
to learn what Hardy and No. 8 had seen, much
to the relief of the latter.</p>

<p>Benny and Fluff spent several hours during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
afternoon with the lookout on the hill, and when
Keeper Downey hove in sight the lad walked slowly
toward the station, whispering to the dog in his
arms:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Fluffy to rush right up the minute
Mr. Downey gets back and ask to see the uniform;
but I do hope it won&rsquo;t be very long before he shows
us what he has brought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time Benny arrived at the boat-house door
the keeper was mooring his dory, and a few moments
later the lad saw him step ashore with a package
in his arms so large that it hid at least half of
his body from view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has really brought the clothes, Fluffy, and
it oughtn&rsquo;t to be such a dreadful while before we
can look at them, because supper won&rsquo;t be ready
for two hours, and he&rsquo;ll have nothing else to do
except show all hands what the tailor has made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was not kept long in suspense. As Tom
Downey approached the building he cried to the
expectant lad:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the mess-room, No. 8; I&rsquo;ve brought
home all your finery, and the crew will be wantin&rsquo;
to see how you look in the uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny answered the summons hastily, and Fluff
ran at his heels barking shrilly, as if he had some
personal interest in that which the keeper was carrying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
With the exception of Robbins, who was acting
as lookout, every member of the crew was awaiting
Tom Downey&rsquo;s arrival when he entered, looking
particularly cheerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got all I went for, and a little besides,&rdquo;
he said, still holding the package in his arms.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, I haven&rsquo;t taken advantage of you
fellows by looking at the toggery. It was wrapped
up when I got to the tailor&rsquo;s, and beyond the little
he told me, I know no more about what&rsquo;s inside the
paper than you do. Now I propose that Benny take
this bundle, go up-stairs, put on the uniform, and
dazzle us all by suddenly appearing as a full-fledged
life-saver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to fix it!&rdquo; Sam Hardy cried
enthusiastically. &ldquo;Get along, No. 8, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
spend too much time primpin&rsquo;, for we&rsquo;re achin&rsquo; to
get a sight of you in brass buttons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny did as he was bidden, and a few moments
after he had disappeared up the stairway those below
heard an exclamation of astonishment, followed
an instant later by the question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that other thing, Mr. Downey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tailor said he&rsquo;d put in something on his
own account for Fluff. Try it on and send him
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crew were wholly at a loss to understand the
meaning of this brief conversation until the dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
came down-stairs at full speed, yelping and barking
as if in the highest state of excitement and pleasure.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter burst from the men when the
little fellow sat up on his tail in the centre of the
room, as if asking that he be admired. Over his
silken white hair was strapped a tiny, blue broadcloth
blanket, on the two rear corners of which was
worked in white silk the letters &ldquo;L.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.&rdquo; so disposed
as to form a fanciful monogram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for No. 9!&rdquo; Joe Cushing cried,
and this was responded to with such good-will that
Fluff hurriedly ran back to his master, thoroughly
frightened by the noisy demonstration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he look great?&rdquo; Benny cried, and Tom
Downey replied with a laugh:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed he does, lad; but you needn&rsquo;t stay up
there admiring him, for we&rsquo;re more anxious to see
your rig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, moving slowly and shyly, as if almost
ashamed of his fine feathers, Benny made his appearance
on the stairs, and it was an exclamation of
genuine admiration with which he was greeted.
The little fellow looked manly in the neatly fitting
suit of blue, bedecked with brass buttons, and very
proud withal, for, although he considered himself a
member of the crew, the fact had never seemed so
real to him as at this moment when he was attired
as a life saver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
The deep crimson blood came into his cheeks as
he stood before the men, in obedience to orders,
turning here and there as one or the other dictated,
and listening all the while to words of praise and
genuine admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, No. 8,&rdquo; Sam Hardy said at
length. &ldquo;I was almost afraid that tailor might rig
you out like a jumping-jack, with a lot of folderols
that had no place on a life saver&rsquo;s uniform; but
he&rsquo;s gone straight with the orders I gave him, an&rsquo;
the job couldn&rsquo;t be improved on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re to go into town with
me when next I have leave of absence,&rdquo; Joe Cushing
cried, and then some one called attention to Fluff,
who was sitting on the topmost step, still clad in
uniform, wagging his tail vigorously as if asking
whether it would be safe for him to venture
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call your partner, No. 8, an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s see how the
two of you look together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During fully five minutes Benny and Fluff were
forced to walk here or there in order that the men
might have good opportunity for seeing them in all
possible lights, and then Mr. Downey suggested
that the lad show himself in civilian&rsquo;s garb.</p>

<p>No. 8 obeyed very readily, almost glad to escape
from that atmosphere of praise, and when he next
appeared it was in a suit of clothes such as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
well-dressed boy ten or twelve years of age would
be expected to display.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;"><img id="ip_244" src="images/i254.jpg" width="436" height="580" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>A blue blouse with a rolling collar, sailor-fashion,
knickerbockers, stockings, and a jacket of the same
color, the clothing trimmed neatly with white braid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
made of him, as Dick Sawyer said, &ldquo;a perfect little
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look best in whichever you happen to have
on when you heave in sight,&rdquo; Sam Hardy said admiringly.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it goin&rsquo; to be quite a come-down
to get into your old pea-jacket an&rsquo; sou&rsquo;wester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel more like myself then,&rdquo; Benny said
emphatically. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem right for me to be
dressed up so fine, and most likely it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; too good for you, accordin&rsquo; to
my way of thinkin&rsquo;, No. 8, so don&rsquo;t get such queer
ideas into your head. How does young Mr. Foster
feel about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I believe he&rsquo;s proud of his
blanket? I tried to take it off before we came
down, and he growled terribly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a good thing for him when the weather
is biting cold, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d better let him wear it a
spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Benny went up-stairs again in order to
change his clothes once more, preparatory to assisting
the cook, and a stranger would have found it
difficult to decide whether the boy or the crew of
men were most pleased because of the new clothes.</p>

<p>During the four days which followed the arrival
of the uniform, No. 8 was kept busily employed
about the station, except during such times as he
went on patrol with Sam Hardy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Because of the wreckers in the vicinity, and the
many visitors who came to see the stranded
steamer, it seemed as if the buildings were thronged
with strangers during the greater portion of each
day, and when the lad was not at work in the
kitchen, he found quite as much as he could conveniently
do in &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; after the careless
ones, who appeared to think it would make little
difference to a &ldquo;crew of men&rdquo; if a greater or less
amount of mud or snow was brought in on the
cleanly scrubbed floors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the steamer ain&rsquo;t hauled off mighty soon,
No. 8 will wear himself down to skin an&rsquo; bone,
trying to make the place look tidy,&rdquo; Dick Sawyer
said after a party of slovenly visitors had taken their
departure. &ldquo;It makes me tired to see him running
around from mornin&rsquo; till night with a swab in
his hands, an&rsquo; ten minutes after he&rsquo;s scrubbed
every board clean, a fresh layer of dirt is brought
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get a rest by to-morrow, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo;
Joe Cushing replied, &ldquo;an&rsquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me
such a terrible sight if all the wreckers&rsquo; work was
undone before twenty-four hours go by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may get a little blow from the eastward,
but I ain&rsquo;t countin&rsquo; on anything that can be called
a storm,&rdquo; Dick said carelessly as he followed No. 8
into the oil-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Before night had come there were many in and
around the station who shared Joe Cushing&rsquo;s opinion
as to the weather.</p>

<p>Everything about the wreck was made as snug as
possible; extra hawsers were run out, the hatches
battened down, and the lighters anchored in deep
water.</p>

<p>Instead of lying off the cove when the day&rsquo;s work
was done, the tugs ran over to the city, and all the
small boats were hauled up beyond reach of the
waves.</p>

<p>Sam Hardy was the first to go on patrol this
night, and, as a matter of course, Benny accompanied
him, for since the affair in the hold of the
steamer the surfman had appeared more than usually
eager for the companionship of his young comrade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; the fat of the work this night,&rdquo;
Hardy said as the two left the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? Ain&rsquo;t we going
to stay out the full four hours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we are, lad; but the wind won&rsquo;t get up
much before midnight, an&rsquo; when it does come I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo; it will bring rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you believe as Mr. Cushing does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lookin&rsquo;, as Joe is, for anything very
heavy, but allow it won&rsquo;t be pleasant for the patrol
who comes after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Save that the wind was blowing freshly, Benny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
saw no indications of a storm, and whatever might
have been the appearance of the sky, it would have
had no meaning for him after Sam Hardy delivered
his opinion.</p>

<p>Their beat led them past where the stranded
steamer lay, now considerably more than half unloaded,
and at this point a long halt was made.</p>

<p>As yet the surf had not risen, although the wind
had been steadily increasing in force since sunset,
and the lighters rose and fell on the gentle swell
with but little tugging at their cables. White foam
around the wreck told that the rising tide was churning
against her sides; but with no more force than
while the wreckers had been at work.</p>

<p>To Benny, particularly after hearing Hardy&rsquo;s
opinion, there was no reason for the life savers to
feel disturbed in mind, and, when the tour of duty
having come to an end, he returned to the station,
it was with the belief that the repose of the crew
would be undisturbed.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly tired, as he had been every
night since the stranded steamer attracted so many
visitors, and went to bed immediately after entering
the building, failing to observe what at another
time might have drawn his attention&mdash;that every
member of the crew yet remained in the mess-room
as if anticipating a sudden call to duty.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he must have been asleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
several hours when Fluff&rsquo;s shrill barking aroused
him, and, sitting bolt upright in bed he observed,
much to his surprise, that none of the men, with
the exception of the cook, who regularly retired at
an early hour, had been in the sleeping-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;"><img id="ip_249" src="images/i259.jpg" width="437" height="384" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Covering Fluff&rsquo;s mouth to still his barking, Benny
listened.</p>

<p>It was evident Joe Cushing had just come in from
patrol, and was making a report of rather an alarming
nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to the laboring of the steamer, one
of the lighters appears to be dragging anchor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
if she sweeps down upon the stranded craft there&rsquo;ll
be no more work for the wreckers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny was out of bed in an instant, for he knew
that the crew would set about repairing the mischief
without delay, and it was not his intention to
be left behind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;"><img id="ip_250" src="images/i260.jpg" width="431" height="365" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Dressing hurriedly, he descended the stairs just
as the men were putting on their oiled clothing,
and without comment he began following their
example.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, No. 8, what are you about?&rdquo; the keeper
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t the crew going out, sir?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but not on what you might call life-saving
work. It&rsquo;s only a &rsquo;longshore job of caring for
lighters, with more hard work than glory in it. We
may be knocking around from one of those tubs to
the other until daylight, and it&rsquo;ll be wiser for you
to stay under cover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny immediately removed the coat he had put
on; but it could readily be seen that he was sorely
disappointed at thus being advised to remain in the
station, for advice from the keeper was to him
nothing less than a positive command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll grieve him mightily to be here while we&rsquo;re
at work,&rdquo; Sam Hardy whispered to Mr. Downey,
and the latter replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier for him to feel sorry than to be
knocking around with us all night, for I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;
this is a job that ain&rsquo;t soon to be ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be as hard for him as to stay here with
the cook. No. 8 ain&rsquo;t a lad who&rsquo;s afraid of work,
as he&rsquo;s shown us every day since he came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Downey hesitated a moment, and then said
slowly, as does one who is not certain that he speaks
wisely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had rather take the chances with us,
when we&rsquo;re setting out to do nothing more than
get a lot of scows into shape, come along, Benny.
It was only in order to save you a long spell of hard
work that I proposed you should stay behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it don&rsquo;t make any difference to you, sir, I&rsquo;d
much rather go,&rdquo; Benny replied in a low tone.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t seem that I really was No. 8 if the
crew went away without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get into your oil-skins, since you&rsquo;re so greedy
for hard work, lad, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll start. You&rsquo;ll see this
night the dullest piece of drudgery that life savers
were ever put to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny&rsquo;s face was actually aglow with pleasure
when this permission had been given, and before
the foremost of the crew could leave the mess-room
he was clad in his oiled clothing, eager to share
whatever might be the portion of his comrades.</p>

<p>To the boy&rsquo;s delight, the life-boat was to be used
for the work. He had never been on board of her,
and it would indeed have seemed hard had this
opportunity been denied him.</p>

<p>Not until the buoyant craft had been pulled out
beyond the point did No. 8 realize that in his
weather predictions Sam Hardy had made a failure.
The wind was blowing freshly from the northeast,
the rain was falling, and the waves had risen until
the heavy boat was flung about like a cork.</p>

<p>The crew plied their oars in silence; all evidently
looked upon the work of securing the lighters in
exactly the same light as did Tom Downey&mdash;as
drudgery,&mdash;and there was nothing to animate them.
If a vessel with a crew on board had been in distress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
each man would have been on the alert and
eager, straining every muscle without thought of
fatigue, instead of which they were now dispirited.</p>

<p>Not until they were within fifty yards of the
lighter which lay nearest the point, could Benny
distinguish any object on the rolling waters, and
then he began to understand how difficult a task
had the crew taken upon themselves.</p>

<p>The huge fabrics, hardly more than scows, were
wallowing in the waves, sending up great clouds of
spray when the seas broke with a noise like thunder
under the square bows or sterns, and the lad, ignorant
though he was regarding such work, knew full
well that it would be more difficult to board one of
the hulks than to clamber over the rail of an ordinary
wreck.</p>

<p>The order was given to &ldquo;cease rowing,&rdquo; and as
the oars were held firmly in the water to prevent
the life-boat from being blown at the mercy of the
wind, Keeper Downey studied how he might best
accomplish the difficult task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all dragging their anchors,&rdquo; he said
after a brief silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and would in this shallow water, no matter
what weight of metal they had out,&rdquo; Dick Sawyer
grumbled. &ldquo;If the wreckers are willing to leave
their hulks on such a shore as this, without so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
as a single man aboard, it would serve them right
to lose the whole boiling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to board that lighter!&rdquo; Downey
finally exclaimed, giving no heed to Dick&rsquo;s grumbling.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a nice job, boys, but must be
done, else those hulks will be driven down upon the
steamer. Stand by, 1, 2, 4, and 5,&rdquo; he added,
designating the men by their numbers.</p>

<p>No protest was made, although the life savers
knew they were ordered to far more dangerous work
than would be theirs if human lives were to be
wrested from the waters.</p>

<p>The men referred to hauled in their oars, and the
remainder of the crew, Benny doing his best with
the heavy implement Sam had been wielding, worked
the life-boat around until she was to leeward of the
lighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump when I give the word, and then slack
away on the cables. Look around for spare anchors!
If any be found, heave them out; but remember
that you must work lively! Are you ready?
jump!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four men leaped as one, and the life-boat was
hurled back by the impetus until a dozen yards of
water tumbled between her and the lighter.</p>

<p>A long sigh of relief escaped from Benny&rsquo;s lips as
he saw that his comrades had gained a safe footing
on the rolling, pitching hulk, and then it was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
that he give his undivided attention to working
the oar, lest the waves should wrest it from his grasp.</p>

<p>Downey&rsquo;s purpose was to keep the life-boat under
the lee of the lighter to lessen the labor of his men,
and even this was an extremely difficult matter, for
the sea increased in violence momentarily, while
there were but three men and a boy at the oars.</p>

<p>Hardy, Cushing, Sawyer, and Henderson were
the men detailed for the work of securing the heavy
hulk, and there were none among the crew stronger
or more able to perform the task, yet it was soon
seen that they were working at a great disadvantage
owing to lack of numbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no spare anchors here!&rdquo; Hardy cried
out after he had been on board the unwieldy craft
ten minutes or more. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only an apology
for a windlass, an&rsquo; I question if it won&rsquo;t go by the
board before many hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her more scope, for it&rsquo;s all we can do, and
get on board again smartly; the lighter nearest inshore
is dragging badly,&rdquo; Downey shouted in reply.</p>

<p>As was afterward learned, the men had but just
loosened the carelessly laid turns from the shaky
windlass when a huge sea lifted the stern of the
lighter high in the air, and, passing forward, allowed
the heavy after part to drop into the trough of the
sea with a snap that would have tested the timbers
of a strong vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Those on board the life-boat heard a crashing and
rending as of wood; saw the huge hulk rise again
on a wave, and then came the cry from Joe Cushing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The windlass has gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as he spoke it seemed as if the heavy fabric,
lifting such a height of side against the wind that it
acted as a sail, literally leaped forward directly upon
the life-boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stern all! Lively, boys! Lively!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny laid all his strength against the huge oar,
and yet he could not push it back so much as an
inch; but his efforts might have been of some avail
in connection with the quick, muscular work of the
others, and the boat was forced out of the way only
so much as was absolutely necessary. The failure
of an inch in distance, and she must have been
crushed by the ponderous weight which overhung
her until Benny felt certain they would be swamped.</p>

<p>This necessary man&oelig;uvre exposed the life-boat to
the full force of the wind, and before she could be
brought round again, half-manned as she was, fully
fifty yards of water separated her from the lighter
whereon were the four life savers now turned
mariners in distress.</p>

<p>Because no one of his companions spoke, Benny
believed the danger which menaced his comrades
on the hulk to be very great, and a sensation of
faintness came over him as he thought that perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
he might never again clasp the hands of those whom
he had learned to love.</p>

<p>With a full crew on the life-boat it would have
been a comparatively easy task to rescue the men
from the lighter; but under the circumstances it
was difficult work to even so much as hold her
against the wind, and in the meanwhile the huge
craft was approaching the breakers at a speed that
must soon put her beyond reach of help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your very life into the oars, boys!&rdquo; Downey
cried appealingly. &ldquo;We must lay her so near
alongside that we can pass our comrades a rope, for
we can&rsquo;t hope to help them from the shore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every one, including Benny, had been working to
the full extent of his power, yet it seemed now as
if still greater strength was laid on the oars, as
Downey shouted to their comrades:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by for a line, boys! Make it fast, and
come in on it. I see no other chance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her drift in on the shoal!&rdquo; Hardy cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are too big odds against all of us using
your line, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll hold on a spell after she strikes.
You four can manage the surf-boat, an&rsquo; I allow
there&rsquo;s time to get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; the keeper exclaimed. &ldquo;I must
have lost my head when I thought they could come
in hand-over-hand while there&rsquo;s such a sea on.
Buckle to the oars, boys! We&rsquo;ll make the station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
if we can; but if not, beach this craft as near as
possible. We&rsquo;ve a poor crew indeed, if our comrades
are allowed to drown while they&rsquo;ve got so
many timbers under them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While speaking he had swung the boat around
head on to the shore, and every man tugged and
strained at his ashen blade, while Downey lent all
possible assistance with the steering oar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never make the station!&rdquo; Benny heard
Robbins, who was directly in front of him mutter,
and almost at the same instant the keeper cried
hoarsely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must take our chances in the cove, boys.
No. 8, get hold of a cork jacket and come aft
before we strike!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">CAST ASHORE.</span></h2>

<p>Benny understood the command given by Keeper
Downey, but could not make up his mind as to
how it might be obeyed. It seemed to him in the
highest degree important that he keep to work with
the oar, and yet he could not lay hold of a life-preserver
without dropping it.</p>

<p>After having thus attended to the boy&rsquo;s safety so
far as was possible, the keeper turned all his attention
to the work of so steering the life-boat that she
would strike the shore at the least dangerous point.</p>

<p>The huge lighter, on which could be seen indistinctly
the forms of the four men, was being driven
rapidly toward the stranded steamer, and it was not
necessary one should have much experience in such
matters to understand that if she struck the wreck
there was little hope the four men could gain the
shore alive.</p>

<p>If the crew had been on the cliff with the beach-apparatus,
watching others being swept down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
coast in such fashion, it would not have appeared to
be a particularly dangerous position, because a line
could be fired across the wreck, or the surf-boat
pulled to wheresoever the lighter might come to
grief.</p>

<p>Now, however, there was no one on shore to lend
assistance, and, as a matter of fact, every member
of the crew was in extreme peril.</p>

<p>Benny watched his helpless comrades as he pulled
at the oar while awaiting the opportunity to lay
hold of a life-preserver, and, observing that he was
not yet prepared for what lay before them, Robbins
asked sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear what the keeper said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but I can&rsquo;t reach one of the jackets
without dropping my oar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it go, then! None of us are doing very
much good now while the wind has such a firm grip
on us, and your strength won&rsquo;t be missed. This is
the time when you must have your wits well about
you, lad, and it&rsquo;s no easy matter to keep a clear
head while floundering in the surf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it certain we&rsquo;ll all be thrown out?&rdquo; Benny
asked as he took up one of the jackets and began
adjusting it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it. If we&rsquo;re lucky, it may
be possible to get the surf-boat afloat before that
lumberin&rsquo; lighter strikes; but I&rsquo;m doubtful as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
our succeeding. In all my experience on this coast
I never before saw the life savers so completely
knocked out as they appear to be now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four men on the unwieldy craft could be seen
making such provisions for their own safety as was
possible under the circumstances. Just abaft of
where the windlass had stood was a narrow hatchway
leading to the shallow hold, and around the
combing of this they ran a short length of rope to
form a life-line. It was a poor makeshift, but one
on which might depend the lives of four men.</p>

<p>In a single hurried glance Benny saw that Sam
Hardy was stripping off the greater portion of his
clothing preparatory to the battle with the surf, and
that the others were peering ahead in the gloom as
if trying to decide at which point the lighter would
take the land.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the life-boat had been racing toward
the shore with marvellous rapidity, flung forward by
both wind and wave, and those on board had no
more than time in which to get a general view of
the surroundings before she was being tossed to and
fro in the broken water which extended a hundred
yards or more from the coast-line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand ready, boys!&rdquo; Tom Downey shouted,
still doing his utmost to guide the light craft by
means of the steering-oar. &ldquo;Leap clear if she turns
over! Robbins, have a care of Benny; but don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
try to do more than keep his head above water till
some of us can give you a lift!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take hold of the back of my coat,&rdquo; the surfman
said to the lad an instant after these orders had
been given. &ldquo;After I have jumped, do your best
to keep on my shoulders, and, above all, don&rsquo;t lose
your courage. Surely we, whose business it is to
save life in the surf, should be able to go through
yonder broken water alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to me, Mr. Robbins,&rdquo;
Benny replied, trying his best, and almost successfully,
to speak in a firm tone. &ldquo;You can save
yourself, and it ain&rsquo;t fair to be bothered with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no time in which to say anything more.
Already was the life-boat rising on the crest of a
gigantic wave which promised to drop her on the
shoal twenty yards or more to seaward of low-water
mark, and all knew that the supreme moment had
come.</p>

<p>Not until this instant did Tom Downey relinquish
the steering-oar, and the others, including Benny,
mentally braced themselves for the struggle which
was close at hand.</p>

<p>Had the men been in the lighter surf-boat, the
wave might have carried them beyond reach of
danger; but the larger craft struck the bottom some
distance from the shore, and it seemed to Benny as
if the stern was flung directly over the bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
The upheaving of the boat threw him far out over
the water before he had time to leap, and ere Robbins
had taken hold of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your courage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words which Robbins had spoken were
ringing in the lad&rsquo;s ears as he was plunged head
foremost into the boiling waters, and he strove
rather to keep his wits about him than to strike out
for the shore.</p>

<p>He was conscious of coming in contact with the
bottom, and then, as he rose to the surface, of being
drawn back forcibly by the undertow, after which
he threw his arms above his head lest he should be
dashed against a rock.</p>

<p>It seemed as if he was whirled to and fro violently,
then flung inshore, only to be dragged back again,
and after that came a bewildering, sickening sensation,
until it seemed as if some heavy object was
pressing directly above him.</p>

<p>Involuntarily he clutched at it, and found a rope
in his grasp.</p>

<p>An instant of confusion, and then he realized that
he was floating by the side of the life-boat.</p>

<p>The craft had righted itself after being up-ended,
for, unless serious damage had been done her hull,
she would always swim in proper fashion, and it so
chanced the waves had carried her directly over the
lad who, by remaining passive in the surf, had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
exactly that which was best calculated to insure his
safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lose my courage!&rdquo; Benny said stoutly,
and his own words served to animate him.</p>

<p>He hauled on the rope until finding that it was
made fast inside the craft, when, by exerting all his
strength, it was possible to clamber inboard, although
by so doing the boat was filled to the gunwales
with water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With this jacket on, and in a life-boat, I can&rsquo;t
sink, and the only fear is that I&rsquo;ll be thrown against
the rocks, the same as a life saver whom Mr. Hardy
knew,&rdquo; Benny said to himself.</p>

<p>Then, clutching the thwart, the lad looked around
him with the idea that he might be able to render
assistance to those of his companions who had not
succeeded in gaining a place of safety.</p>

<p>On the waves near at hand he could see nothing;
but ashore was a small group of men gazing toward
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by for a line!&rdquo; he heard Mr. Downey
shout, and then all fear for himself fled as he
thought of those on the lighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am all right!&rdquo; he cried at the full strength of
his lungs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold on here while you launch
the surf-boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not wait to hear the reply, but looked
hurriedly around for the lighter, and his breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
came quick and fast as he saw the huge craft almost
upon him.</p>

<p>The wind was driving her down on a line with the
stranded steamer, and the life-boat, in her lee and
sheltered from the gale, was being swept by the
undertow in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Now he understood that there were other dangers
than those of being dashed against the rocks, and
for an instant it seemed certain the end had
come.</p>

<p>He saw a human figure standing near the edge of
the huge craft, and to him he shouted wildly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you throw me a line?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no time for a reply. Benny had hardly
more than cried out before the small boat was grating
against the side of the hulk, and at the same
instant he who had been peering over the side
leaped down.</p>

<p>The impetus given by the man&rsquo;s body flung the
life-boat to one side, and in the merest fraction of
time she was astern of the dangerous fabric which
swept onward, leaving a wake behind like that of a
steamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, No. 8?&rdquo; a familiar voice cried, and
Benny shouted in relief and pleasure, for he knew
Sam Hardy was with him once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; he panted as Sam
floundered to his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
&ldquo;Still on board the lighter; but I&rsquo;m not allowin&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s any great danger for &rsquo;em. It begins to
look as if the clumsy hulk would clear the stranded
steamer, in which case they have only to hold on
till the surf-boat can be launched. Seein&rsquo; the life-boat,
I took the chances of jumpin&rsquo; so she wouldn&rsquo;t
be swept out to sea, for it would be queer readin&rsquo;
if the Superintendent got a letter telling that we&rsquo;d
lost a craft like her. How did you happen to be
here alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the fewest possible words Benny explained
what had happened, and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are we goin&rsquo; to get ashore, Mr. Hardy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t troublin&rsquo; me so much just now as is
the question of how we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to keep her from
bein&rsquo; driven back against the cliff. So far as I
could see, all hands except you, got ashore without
any very great trouble, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll soon have the
surf-boat over here. What we must do is to keep
off the rocks, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;ll be a reasonably hard job
with such a cargo of water as we&rsquo;ve got aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can bail her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well try to dip up the ocean, for every wave
is sweepin&rsquo; over us here in this broken water.
We&rsquo;re all right for a spell, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to
prevent our watchin&rsquo; the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny would have made an attempt to do whatever
Sam Hardy might have suggested, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
wild or impossible, and now did his best at peering
through the gloom toward that dark mass which he
knew was the lighter.</p>

<p>He could distinguish nothing on the shore; but
the surfman, having had more experience, declared
that he could see quite plainly the forms of their
comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t dare spend the time to go after the
surf-boat, but will trust to what they can do with
ropes from the shore. The wreckers have left
enough gear behind to furnish each man with a
life-line, and since there&rsquo;s no longer any danger the
lighter will strike the steamer, it won&rsquo;t be a hard
job to bring every fellow ashore. I&rsquo;m still wonderin&rsquo;
what made me jump when I saw the boat,
Benny. It was a fool trick, after yonder hulk had
taken such a turn as showed she&rsquo;d strike a sandy
bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was mighty lucky for me that you did come,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, lad? I can&rsquo;t do the first thing toward
helpin&rsquo; us out of this plight, except by usin&rsquo; the
steerin&rsquo;-oar when we&rsquo;re nearer in shore, an&rsquo; you
may as well have been alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been terribly frightened; but now
everything is all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam gathered the boy in his arms for an instant,
but made no reply, and during those few seconds it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
seemed as if the two were nearer in spirit than they
had ever been before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s struck!&rdquo; the surfman cried at length,
referring to the lighter, and Benny saw a huge
cloud of spray rise in the air as if against the base
of a cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we first went adrift, Joe Cushing figgered
that the danger of bein&rsquo; washed away wouldn&rsquo;t be
very great, provided she went clear of the steamer,
for the deck is so broad, and her depth so great,
that the waves won&rsquo;t make a clean breach over her.
In their places, I&rsquo;d take the chances of stayin&rsquo;
there till the tide falls, rather than trust to a hand-rope
through the surf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam continued to gaze first at the huge hulk and
then at the shore, regardless of his own danger,
until Benny recalled him to the fact that the life-boat
was being driven directly toward a cliff of
brown rocks a quarter of a mile beyond where the
life savers ashore were stationed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on where you are till I give the word,&rdquo;
Sam cried as he unshipped one of the spare oars
from its beckets and swung it out over the stern.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain one man can do much more than
hold this boat before the wind, and if we find that
she ain&rsquo;t to be turned from her course, we&rsquo;ll try the
surf again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I help you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, lad, except by sittin&rsquo; still an&rsquo; obeyin&rsquo;
orders. Don&rsquo;t be frightened, for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to scare me now you&rsquo;re
here,&rdquo; Benny replied with sublime confidence, and
the surfman muttered a few words under his breath,
the purport of which Benny failed to hear.</p>

<p>From this moment the two in the boat ceased to
pay any attention to their comrades either on shore
or aboard the lighter; their own situation demanded
every thought, and while Sam Hardy would not
have admitted as much to his companion, he was
seriously concerned regarding the possibility of
warding off the threatening danger.</p>

<p>Freighted with water as the life-boat was, she
sailed sluggishly before the blast, with not sufficient
headway to prevent the waves from breaking over
her continuously, and it was necessary her crew
should exercise every care to prevent themselves
from being washed overboard.</p>

<p>There was no deviation from the course, however;
straight toward that frowning cliff the wind and
waves forced her, and the surfman knew full well,
although he refrained from giving words to the fact,
that it was not in the power of man to aid them if
they struck the rocks, where the waves would beat
them to and fro until life was crushed out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must take to the water, Benny,&rdquo; Sam
Hardy said at length, doing his best to speak in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
cheery tone. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t an overly pleasant idee;
but goes &rsquo;way ahead of stayin&rsquo; aboard till we can&rsquo;t
help ourselves. Can you swim any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little in smooth water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a cork jacket on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and it kept me up in great shape before,
so you needn&rsquo;t bother about me, for I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
drown so long as I keep my courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid but you&rsquo;ll contrive to do that
last. Now listen: we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to take to the water
mighty soon; I&rsquo;ll go over, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re to follow
close behind. Once we&rsquo;re afloat, keep a firm hold
of my shirt collar from behind, an&rsquo; see to it your
grip is not loosened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t try to drag me, Mr. Hardy. It&rsquo;s
certain you&rsquo;ll come out all right alone, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benny, I&rsquo;d sooner never go ashore than get
there without you,&rdquo; Sam replied, speaking very
gravely; &ldquo;so we won&rsquo;t make any talk about that
part of it. Do as I&rsquo;ve said, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll both be
back at the station to-morrow mornin&rsquo;, or neither
of us shows up there again. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever you say the word, sir,&rdquo; Benny replied
stoutly, although it seemed as if his heart was
in his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to leave the life-boat, but the Government
can easier buy a new one than I can get another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
lease of life, so here goes. Stand close by my side,
No. 8, an&rsquo; jump with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy obeyed promptly, although the strongest
man might well have been excused for hesitating
at such a leap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;"><img id="ip_271" src="images/i281.jpg" width="434" height="384" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The water did not run in waves at this point, but
swirled and foamed over the rocks beneath in eddying
circles which threatened to suck down everything
within reach until it was like a seething mass
of boiling yeast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s depth enough to prevent us from
coming to harm against the bottom,&rdquo; Sam said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
reassuringly, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve only to swim a quarter
of a mile before gaining a good landing-place, even
if Tom Downey don&rsquo;t send some one to help us.
All ready, lad! Keep your wits about you, an&rsquo;
leave the rest with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sam flung his arm around the boy&rsquo;s waist,
pressing the lad close to him as he leaped.</p>

<p>Down, down, until it seemed to Benny as if they
would never reach the bottom, and then came the
up-rising, followed by the blessed relief of being
able to breathe once more.</p>

<p>It had not been the lad&rsquo;s purpose to follow Sam
Hardy&rsquo;s instructions to the letter.</p>

<p>He had not intended to allow himself to be
dragged through the waves at risk of weighting
down his comrade, but proposed to strike out for
himself; and the surfman must have feared some
such intention, for, fastening his teeth in the sleeve
of Benny&rsquo;s shirt, he held on as a dog might have
done.</p>

<p>The boy understood that Hardy could swim more
easily if he held himself up by clutching the latter&rsquo;s
shirt collar, and as soon as he did this the surfman
released his hold.</p>

<p>So low on the surface of the water were the two,
it was impossible to gain any idea of where the life
savers or the hulk might be.</p>

<p>They were alone amid those angry, seething<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
waters, and it was not reasonable to suppose their
comrades could see them.</p>

<p>Had he been dependent upon his own exertions,
Benny must speedily have succumbed to the violent
buffeting of the waves; but Sam Hardy shielded
the lad whenever it was possible, in addition to
dragging him past the frowning rocks, and finally,
after it seemed to the lad as if half the night had
been spent, they had arrived at a cove which offered
a comparatively safe landing-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand up as soon as your feet touch bottom,
and run for dear life,&rdquo; Hardy said, speaking for the
first time since they had flung themselves into the
waves, and the words were no more than uttered
when Benny was able to obey.</p>

<p>Hand in hand the two fled from the raging waters,
only to be overtaken and hurled back at the very
moment when it seemed as if a place of safety had
been gained, and then came another wearying, disheartening
conflict with the waves, during which
Benny nearly lost his courage.</p>

<p>Once more it was possible to gain a foothold;
once more they raced with death, and this time the
venture was successful. The two gained the pebbly
shore above the water-line, so sorely beaten and
fatigued that speech or movement was impossible
until after a rest of several minutes.</p>

<p>Then Sam asked solicitously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
&ldquo;How are you feelin&rsquo;, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; Benny replied, panting so
heavily that it was only with the greatest difficulty
he could articulate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t the kind of a night when a fellow can
lay along the shore very long without running the
risk of freezin&rsquo; to death. We&rsquo;d best be movin&rsquo; as
soon as you can walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready now,&rdquo; and Benny rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw off that cork-jacket; take hold of my
hand, and once we&rsquo;ve started, keep movin&rsquo; as long
as it&rsquo;s possible to breathe. We came out of that
smother all right, an&rsquo; now are bound to get back to
the station in such shape that we&rsquo;ll be able to do
our full share of the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will the crew try to do anything more, now
that the life-boat is gone?&rdquo; Benny asked as he followed
at a rapid pace by Sam&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re obliged to do all we can to prevent
wreck, an&rsquo; a dip like this don&rsquo;t excuse us from a full
share of duty when there&rsquo;s pressin&rsquo; need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would seem different if there was any one
aboard the steamer or lighters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are called on to save property as well as
lives, lad, an&rsquo; whatever danger we may have been
in, or must face later, don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no question in Benny&rsquo;s mind but that
the three men had been taken safely from the hulk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
because Sam Hardy declared they would be, which
declaration was the same to him as a fact; therefore
he felt no anxiety until they were within fifty yards
of where the lighter lay stranded upon the sands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boys are still there,&rdquo; the surfman said as
he halted an instant to peer seaward. &ldquo;I reckon
they&rsquo;re right comfortable, though, for the surf
doesn&rsquo;t break over them very badly, and it will
soon be possible to give them a line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Downey and the others?&rdquo; Benny
asked, gazing around but without seeing any sign
of life upon the shore.</p>

<p>Sam Hardy stopped only sufficiently long to assure
himself they were not in the vicinity, and then
replied in a tone of conviction:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone back to the station for the beach-wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they never got ashore,&rdquo; Benny added
in a whisper of awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get such an idea as that in your head,
lad. I&rsquo;d answer for it every one didn&rsquo;t go under,
an&rsquo; the fact that there are none here is proof each
man answered to his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose they thought had become
of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t cut any figger in their thoughts,
lad. Most likely Downey knew I jumped aboard
the life-boat, an&rsquo; after that he counted us out when
reckonin&rsquo; how many was in need of help. We&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
push on, for it&rsquo;ll be a hard tug gettin&rsquo; that cart
over these rocks with only half a crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the other lighters adrift?&rdquo; Benny asked as
he followed his comrade at a smart pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad, an&rsquo; as near as I can make out, two of
them are afoul of the steamer. There&rsquo;ll be a pretty
mess there when the sun rises, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be hauled
over the coals for it; but I&rsquo;ll thank anybody to tell
me how we could have done more than we did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Benny gave little heed to the
fate of the stranded steamer; if the three men could
be safely taken from the lighter he believed there
would be cause for rejoicing, even though all hulks
alongshore were dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>Before the two had traversed more than a third
of the distance from the scene of the disaster to the
station they came upon the remnant of the crew
dragging the beach-apparatus.</p>

<p>Benny may have thought that the keeper would at
least congratulate them upon their escape, but he did
nothing of the kind. Danger was too frequent a visitor
to cause much comment, save at the very moment
of its appearance, and the keeper said quietly, as if
they had been engaged in some ordinary duty:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got ashore, eh? Where&rsquo;s the life-boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other side of Jefford&rsquo;s reef. While the
wind holds in this quarter there&rsquo;s no fear she&rsquo;ll
drift far, an&rsquo; we can pick her up in the mornin&rsquo;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take hold here, and let us finish this job as
soon as may be, for I don&rsquo;t like the idea of leaving
the remainder of the coast without a patrol&rdquo;; and
he added after the wagon was in motion once more,
with Sam and Benny in the rope harness, &ldquo;Did the
other lighters come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re grindin&rsquo; the steamer into toothpicks.
Even if we had all hands out there in the big boat,
it would be impossible to do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Downey replied impatiently,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; yet it will seem to others as if we might have
done more. A pretty story we&rsquo;ve got to tell about
this night&rsquo;s work! A crew of life savers wrecked in
a life-boat! If we&rsquo;re not the sport of every man in
the Service from this out, I&rsquo;ll eat my hat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet there&rsquo;s no man livin&rsquo; who could have
foreseen what happened. It was the proper thing
to send us on board the lighter, an&rsquo; if her gear gave
way, we&rsquo;re not to be blamed for it,&rdquo; Sam replied
earnestly, and Tom Downey remained silent.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">A LETTER.</span></h2>

<p>When the beach-wagon had been hauled into
position, the work of rescuing the life savers from
the lighter was trifling, and the three were no more
than ashore before Keeper Downey cried sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, let&rsquo;s get the apparatus home, and
the patrol out as soon as may be. There&rsquo;s some
show of excuse for our not being able to save the
property here; but in case a vessel came ashore
while we were foolin&rsquo; around with a lot of lighters,
and life should be lost, we&rsquo;d find ourselves in a bad
pickle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The keeper was not the only member of the crew
who feared that the night&rsquo;s misadventure might
have some fatal ending. The same thought was in
the mind of every man, and it was not necessary to
urge them forward.</p>

<p>Benny welcomed the opportunity to restore the
circulation of blood to his chilled limbs, and pushed
with the utmost of his strength at the tail of the
cart by the keeper&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
The heavy wagon was dragged over the rocks and
through the sand at a rate of speed which, under
other circumstances, might have been impossible,
and when they had nearly arrived at the station
Tom Downey was less apprehensive regarding the
possibility of a wreck, for at that moment they were
passing over the highest point of the cliffs, from
which a good view of the ocean could be had.</p>

<p>Save for a few fleecy clouds, the sky was clear,
and the twinkling stars gave out sufficient light
to show that not a sail was within their range of
vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon we can count the worst of our work as
bein&rsquo; over for this night; but there won&rsquo;t be a very
pretty picture alongshore to-morrow morning,&rdquo; the
keeper said to Benny, and the latter replied with a
tone of thankfulness in his voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things will look better than you believed at
one time, Mr. Downey, for then it seemed as if
you&rsquo;d be called upon to hunt for the bodies of the
crew among the wreckage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are, my lad, and it&rsquo;s little less than
a sin to grumble because two or three lighters and a
stranded steamer may have been broken up, when
the crew came safely through as tough a place as
they were ever in. It&rsquo;s a great pity I allowed you
to go with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve come out of it without any more harm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
than any of the others, sir, and it will help me along
in learning to be a surfman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have got the lesson in an easier
fashion, lad. It&rsquo;s hard enough for tough men like
us to have the clothing frozen to our bodies, but a
boy like you can&rsquo;t well stand such hardships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m all right, sir,&rdquo; Benny replied, striving
in vain to prevent his teeth from chattering with the
cold. &ldquo;Leastways, I will be as soon as we get to
the station, and this work with the cart warms a
fellow up wonderfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Downey did not reply until after a long pause,
and then he said emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If pluck is necessary in the making of a good
surfman, you should be a rare hand at the business,
No. 8, before another year has passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a welcome it was which Benny received
from Fluff when they finally arrived at the station
and the beach-wagon had been hauled into the boat-house!</p>

<p>The tiny dog capered, and barked, and yelped
until it seemed as if he realized how great had been
the danger to which his master was exposed, and so
violently loving were his demonstrations that Benny
could not make any headway at changing his
clothing until after having devoted a certain time
to his pet.</p>

<p>Then the dog greeted each of the men in turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
and Joe Cushing said as he took him almost affectionately
in his arms:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You an&rsquo; No. 8 make up such a team, small
though you are, as I never had the good fortune to
see before.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;"><img id="ip_281" src="images/i291.jpg" width="435" height="366" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>A pot of steaming coffee was on the stove, and
the cook spread on the table such provisions as were
most conveniently at hand, in order that those who
were forced to go out on the coast again to do patrol
duty might refresh themselves without waste of
time.</p>

<p>Once the men had put on dry clothing it was as
if all previous dangers were forgotten, and Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Hardy suggested that they man the surf-boat in
order to go in search of the life-boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll pound herself to pieces on the rocks
&rsquo;twixt now an&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;, whereas by a bit of hard
work at this time we may save her, an&rsquo; in so doin&rsquo;
prevent it from bein&rsquo; said along the shore that we
allowed such a craft to be wrecked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Downey hesitated; he questioned whether he
was warranted in risking human lives to save what
might be replaced by an expenditure of dollars and
cents, and perhaps would have turned a deaf ear to
Sam&rsquo;s suggestion, but that every other member of
the crew evinced a strong desire to make the attempt.</p>

<p>Their record for saving life and property was exceptionally
good at the Department, as every man
knew full well, and to get such a black mark as
must be set down against them in case the life-boat
should be lost, was anything rather than pleasing to
contemplate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I claim that we are not warranted in taking the
chances,&rdquo; Downey said slowly and thoughtfully;
&ldquo;but if you fellows are so set on it, we&rsquo;ll make the
try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke Benny began to overhaul the spare
oil-skins&mdash;the suit he wore when they set out before
having been thrown off when he with Hardy leaped
into the water&mdash;, and Downey asked sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you about, lad?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another small coat here somewhere,&rdquo;
and Benny hurriedly tossed over the assortment of
waterproof garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and what if there is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say we were to go for the life-boat,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crew laughed heartily, as if there was something
exceedingly ludicrous in this question, and
Benny looked around in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you count on going with us?&rdquo; Downey
asked, as soon as he could control his mirth sufficiently
to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would let me, sir, seeing as how
I went the first time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we were so foolish as to take you then,
there is no reason for committing the same fault
again. You are to stay here with the cook and
Fluff C. Foster. Once in a night is enough for you
to risk your life when there&rsquo;s no especial call for so
doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny appeared positively pained, and Sam
Hardy whispered to him while the others were
making their preparations:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be right, lad, for us to take you,
even though it might be convenient, which it isn&rsquo;t.
We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; in the surf-boat, and there will be snug
stowin&rsquo; when the full crew is aboard. If it was a
case of fair weather an&rsquo; smooth water you&rsquo;d have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
to stay behind, because we couldn&rsquo;t pack you in;
so look cheerful, an&rsquo; see to it that we have plenty
of hot coffee on our return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This explanation comforted the boy greatly, and
he at once set about doing what he could to assist
in the preparations for departure.</p>

<p>Then, after the boat had been launched and the
men pulled off on their perilous work, with Fluff in
his arms he stood at the entrance of the boat-house,
watching until the tiny craft was swallowed up in
the darkness, and when it was no longer possible to
distinguish any object upon the heaving waters the
lad returned to the mess-room, there to make ready
an appetizing meal for his comrades.</p>

<p>The cook had taken advantage of the opportunity
to go to bed immediately the crew returned with
the beach-wagon, and Benny was in sole command of
the kitchen with, as he said, &ldquo;Fluff acting as mate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not until two hours had elapsed did the life savers
return, and then they brought the life-boat with
them, none the worse, so Dick Sawyer declared, for
the pounding she had received upon the rocks.</p>

<p>Benny met them at the door of the boat-house,
and, as might have been expected, was eager to
learn whether any serious injury had been wrought.</p>

<p>As soon as the two boats were housed, and before
they entered the mess-room, Sam Hardy gave an
account of the work by saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
&ldquo;We found her just inside the broken water
near where you an&rsquo; I went overboard. It&rsquo;s
likely she&rsquo;s been flung against the cliff a good
many times; but, so far as we can make out,
scratched paint is the only damage done. It
wasn&rsquo;t a wonderfully easy job to get hold of her,
but once we were there for that purpose you can
make certain, No. 8, that none of us were minded
to let any ordinary difficulties put an end to the
work. That&rsquo;s all there is to the story, and it can
be seen that you didn&rsquo;t lose anything, except a
disagreeable time, by not going with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Sam was speaking the remainder of the
crew had entered the mess-room, and an exclamation
of pleasurable surprise burst from the lips of
all as they saw the meal which Benny had made
ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said before, an&rsquo; this proves it, that the
time ain&rsquo;t so far off when No. 8 will be able to pass
examination as our cook,&rdquo; Joe Gushing exclaimed,
and Tom Downey added gravely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we can make something better of the lad
than that. There&rsquo;s too much in Benny for us to
tie him down to such work, and, unless I&rsquo;m greatly
mistaken, he is entitled to look many pegs higher
than a job as surfman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the wearied crew sat themselves down for a
pleasant half-hour, which would not have been enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
had they been forced to depend wholly upon
the man who was paid for preparing their food.</p>

<p>Not until an hour past midnight did Benny go to
bed, and next morning he was down-stairs with the
earliest riser of the crew.</p>

<p>The wind had not spent its fury. On the contrary,
it was blowing a full gale, bringing with it a
downpour of sleet and snow which would prevent
the wrecking tugs from returning to the scene of the
disaster.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast had been eaten all the men,
with the exception of him whose duty it was to
remain on watch, set out to ascertain the amount of
damage done, and, as a matter of course, Benny
accompanied them.</p>

<p>Fluff was given the choice of going with his
master or remaining behind in the warm station,
and after poking his pink nose out of doors for a
single moment, he quickly retreated to the kitchen,
giving evidence, as Sam Hardy declared, of &ldquo;havin&rsquo;
a deal of sound common-sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The situation of affairs in the immediate vicinity
of the steamer was even worse than had been anticipated.
All the lighters but one had crashed into
the stranded craft, making havoc of the timbers as
they forced their heavy bows into the hull, and
completely destroying what the waves had previously
spared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Along the shore in every direction were scattered
fragments of lighters and steamer, until every cove
which made in between the rocks was piled high
with these evidences of devastation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be troubled much longer with wrecking
crews,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said, when they had surveyed
the entire shore in the vicinity. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothin&rsquo; to be done to the steamer except freight
away such parts of her as are worth the savin&rsquo;, and
as for the lighters, they will do no more service
unless it be as kindlin&rsquo; wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet all this might, perhaps, have been
avoided if the wreckers had done their work properly;
but since they didn&rsquo;t, we shall be asked to
explain how it happens we allowed so much property
to be destroyed,&rdquo; Tom Downey said with a sigh,
and Sam Hardy added cheerily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all hands tell the truth, I&rsquo;m not afraid of an
investigation concernin&rsquo; last night&rsquo;s work, for the
crew never lived that, unaided, could have prevented
the heavy craft, fitted with rotten windlasses
and apologies for cables, from goin&rsquo; adrift while the
wind was as strong as when we came out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing the men could do even toward
saving the wreckage nearest the shore while the
storm continued so violent, and after an hour or
more had been spent viewing the scene all hands
returned to the station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
It was an idle day, save as concerned the men on
watch, and after dinner, when Benny would have
pored over the rules regarding drill, Tom Downey
suggested that he make himself thoroughly familiar
with the official instructions for saving drowning
persons, printed for the benefit of the life-saving
men.</p>

<p>During two hours or more No. 8 read and re-read
the following lines, after which Sam Hardy questioned
him on the different points until it was proven
to the satisfaction of all that the lad had learned his
lesson thoroughly.</p>

<p>Since it is to the advantage of every boy who
ventures into the water for pleasure to know exactly
what should be done when another is in danger of
drowning, Benny&rsquo;s afternoon lesson is here set down
exactly as he studied it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;1. When you approach a person drowning in
the water, assure him, with a loud and firm voice,
that he is safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. Before jumping in to save him, divest yourself
as far and as quickly as possible, of all clothes;
tear them off if necessary, but if there is not time,
loose at all events the foot of your drawers, if they
are tied, as, if you do not do so, they fill with water
and drag you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. On swimming to a person in the sea, if he be
struggling, do not seize him then, but keep off a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
seconds till he gets quiet, for it is sheer madness to
take hold of a man when he is struggling in the
water, and if you do you run a great risk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4. Then get close to him and take fast hold of
the hair of his head, turn him as quickly as possible
onto his back, give him a sudden pull, and this will
cause him to float, then throw yourself on your back
also and swim for the shore, both hands having hold
of his hair, you on your back and he also on his, and
of course his back to your stomach. In this way
you will get sooner and safer ashore than by any
other means, and you can easily thus swim with two
or three persons; the writer has even, as an experiment,
done it with four, and gone with them forty
or fifty yards in the sea. One great advantage of
this method is that it enables you to keep your
head up, and also to hold the person&rsquo;s head up you
are trying to save. It is of primary importance that
you take fast hold of the hair and throw both the
person and yourself on your backs. After many
experiments, it is usually found preferable to all
other methods. You can in this manner float nearly
as long as you please, or until a boat or other help
can be obtained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5. It is believed there is no such thing as a
death grasp; at least it is very unusual to witness
it. As soon as a drowning man begins to get feeble
and to lose his recollection, he gradually slackens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
his hold until he quits it altogether. No apprehension
need, therefore, be felt on that head when
attempting to rescue a drowning person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;6. After a person has sunk to the bottom, if the
water be smooth, the exact position where the body
lies may be known by the air-bubbles, which will
occasionally rise to the surface, allowance being of
course made for the motion of the water, if in a
tide-way or stream, which will have carried the
bubbles out of a perpendicular course in rising to
the surface. A body may be often regained from
the bottom, before too late for recovery, by diving
for it in the direction indicated by these bubbles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;7. On rescuing a person by diving to the bottom,
the hair of the head should be seized by one
hand only, and the other used in conjunction with
the feet, in raising yourself and the drowning person
to the surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;8. If in the sea, it may sometimes be a great
error to try to get to land. If there be a strong
&rsquo;outsetting&rsquo; tide, and you are swimming either by
yourself, or have hold of a person who cannot
swim, then get on your back and float till help
comes. Many a man exhausts himself by stemming
the billows for the shore on a back-going tide,
and sinks in the effort, when, if he had floated, a
boat or other aid might have been obtained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;9. These instructions apply alike to all circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
whether as regards the roughest sea or
smooth water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When night came it was what sailors call a
&ldquo;dirty&rdquo; one, and Sam Hardy announced that
Benny would not be allowed to go on patrol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know we made the agreement, lad, that
you might share my watch with me except when
the weather was too bad, and that&rsquo;s what I allow it
to be now. There&rsquo;s no good reason why a boy of
your years an&rsquo; size should tramp up an&rsquo; down this
coast for four hours when nothin&rsquo; more is to come
of it than the toughenin&rsquo; of him. Stay under cover
with Fluff, an&rsquo; if it be so we&rsquo;re called on for work,
you shall take your proper station as No. 8 of this
&rsquo;ere crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny did his best, and succeeded fairly well, in
keeping from his face the disappointment which
came over him at thus being, for the first time, deprived
of the opportunity to share in his comrade&rsquo;s
tasks.</p>

<p>He went to bed while Sam was yet on patrol, and
nothing disturbed his slumbers until next morning
when the cook set about preparing breakfast.</p>

<p>The report from those who had been on duty was
to the effect that no vessels had been sighted during
the night, and that the stranded steamer had been
breaking up rapidly during the past twelve hours.</p>

<p>The sky was yet cloudy, but the snow and sleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
had ceased to fall, and the wind showed signs of
abating.</p>

<p>Before breakfast was ready the wrecking tugs
appeared off shore, and two hours later some of their
crews visited the station.</p>

<p>Keeper Downey wrote out his report, and when
that was done the work of the life savers, so far as
the steamer and lighters were concerned, had come
to an end, except as it might be possible later to
pick up such wreckage as should drift ashore.</p>

<p>Then the crew settled down to the dull routine of
pleasant-weather work, occupying the greater portion
of the time in drilling and patrolling the coast.</p>

<p>Benny could give a very good synopsis of, and in
many cases repeat verbatim, every chapter in the
<i class="cite">Revised Regulations</i>. Each of the crew in turn
had taught Fluff C. Foster a new trick, until his
head was so stored with knowledge of this kind that
a full hour was required in which to display all his
accomplishments, and Joe Cushing had begun to
lay his plans for the day when he and No. 8 were
to visit the city clad in full uniform.</p>

<p>Then came a letter which disturbed all this serenity,
and plunged the inmates of the station into
a most painful state of perplexity and apprehension.</p>

<p>An ordinary-looking envelope covered the missive,
such an one as might have brought an account of
the simplest business transaction, and yet it threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
to change the whole course of affairs for this
particular life-saving crew.</p>

<p>It was addressed simply to the keeper of the
station, and bore the post-mark of a town in the interior
of New York State.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;"><img id="ip_293" src="images/i303.jpg" width="433" height="370" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Tom Downey opened it carelessly, read the lines
hurriedly at first, and then more slowly, as if he
found it difficult to understand the meaning.</p>

<p>He sat with his gaze fixed upon the page so long
that Sam Hardy, who had been questioning Benny
regarding the proper method of landing in a small
boat through the surf, asked curiously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s gone wrong? You look as if there
was bad news in that letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And at first glance it strikes me it <i>is</i> bad news,&rdquo;
the keeper replied. &ldquo;I was tryin&rsquo; to make up my
mind whether it would be well to let all hands know
what may come to us, or if anything would be
gained by keepin&rsquo; it a secret for a spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s bad news, the sooner we know it the better,
accordin&rsquo; to my way of thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Joe Cushing said
promptly; and this remark decided Tom Downey, for
without further hesitation he read the following aloud:</p>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see by the newspapers that the ship <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>
was wrecked near your station, and the sole survivor
was a boy ten or twelve years of age, who gave his
name as Benjamin H. Foster, stating that his father
and mother had died in Calcutta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have every reason to believe that boy to be
my brother&rsquo;s son, in which case it shall be my duty
to care for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you kindly ask him his father&rsquo;s name?
If it should have been &ldquo;Stephen G.,&rdquo; then you
may draw on me for sufficient money to pay young
Benny&rsquo;s passage to this place, and for so much additional
as he may be indebted to you for board and
other necessaries of life.</p>

<p class="in4">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Very respectfully yours,</p>

<p class="sigright">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Andrew Foster</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
For fully a moment after Mr. Downey ceased reading
no one spoke, and the silence was so profound
that Fluff looked anxiously from one to the other
as if fearing some disaster had befallen the crew.</p>

<p>Then it was Sam Hardy who spoke, and he found
it necessary to clear his throat several times before
it was possible to control his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was your father&rsquo;s name, Benny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Stephen G., but I don&rsquo;t believe the man
who wrote that letter is my uncle, because if he is,
why didn&rsquo;t I know something about him? Or,
when father and mother were so sick, why didn&rsquo;t
he write to them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s a question we can&rsquo;t answer,
lad. It may be your folks didn&rsquo;t send him word,
or, perhaps the letters went astray. There are a
dozen good reasons which might be found, and it
ain&rsquo;t likely he&rsquo;d be claimin&rsquo; a boy he never saw if
there wasn&rsquo;t any relationship between &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hung &rsquo;round Calcutta long enough for him to
claim me if he&rsquo;d wanted to, an&rsquo; surely he must have
known father was dead, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve heard mother
say it was reported among the shippin&rsquo; news in all
the American papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be very much pleased at the
idea of havin&rsquo; an uncle up in &rsquo;York State?&rdquo; Sam
Hardy said, speaking a trifle more cheerfully than
before, and Benny cried excitedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
&ldquo;Pleased! Of course I ain&rsquo;t! He can&rsquo;t be much
of an uncle, else he would have helped father an&rsquo;
mother along when they needed it. He can write
a dozen letters before I&rsquo;ll go anywhere to live off
of people that ain&rsquo;t wantin&rsquo; me very bad, else I&rsquo;d
have heard from &rsquo;em long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t a matter to be settled off-hand,
Benny,&rdquo; Keeper Downey said gravely. &ldquo;If the
man who wrote this letter is your uncle, and it
seems he is, I&rsquo;m not certain but that he could force
you by law to go with him. At all events, it&rsquo;s his
duty to give you some help in the world, and we
must look at the matter from all sides before
deciding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d rather I wouldn&rsquo;t stay here, Mr.
Downey, Fluff an&rsquo; me will go off somewhere else;
but we won&rsquo;t take up with his offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Benny,&rdquo; and Sam Hardy,
reaching over, took the boy by the hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no question about our wantin&rsquo; you to stay here, for
we&rsquo;ve come to look on you as belongin&rsquo; to us, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll venture to say I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; now what&rsquo;s in the
heart of every man here. We like you because
you&rsquo;re a sensible mate, an industrious lad, an&rsquo;
one&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; his level best to get into a hard
callin&rsquo;. If we thought only of ourselves that letter
would go into the fire before you could say &lsquo;Jack
Robinson.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s your future that must be considered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
By stayin&rsquo; here you&rsquo;ll never be more &rsquo;n a
surfman, an&rsquo; a lad of your age should aim higher
than that, whether he reaches the mark set or not.
I ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; down upon the business I&rsquo;ve followed
all my life, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll always uphold that it&rsquo;s
an honor to any man to be a member of a life-saving
crew; but at the same time I know, an&rsquo; you know,
that it&rsquo;s possible for a lad to go a good bit higher.
What&rsquo;s decided on now affects your whole life, an&rsquo;
settles whether you&rsquo;re to stay in the life-saving
service, or, perhaps, be a shinin&rsquo; light in the world.
I vote that all hands of us study over this thing till
to-morrow after breakfast, and then let each one,
includin&rsquo; Benny, give the result of his figgerin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the proper way,&rdquo; Tom Downey said
quickly, catching eagerly at the suggestion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
remember all Sam Hardy has said, Benny, for it&rsquo;s
true, so far as regards yourself an&rsquo; us. We want
you with us; but I hope there&rsquo;s nobody in this
crew who would be willing to keep you at the expense
of your future. Think it all over calmly and
quietly, lad, as Sam proposes, an&rsquo; you can count on
this crew doin&rsquo; their level best for whatever may be
to your future good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">A CONSULTATION.</span></h2>

<p>Benny was in a state of mind bordering on despair
when the crew postponed any decided action
on the letter from this uncle of whom he had never
heard before. For the moment it seemed as if
almost any decision would have been better than
the suspense.</p>

<p>It appeared as if his comrades avoided even so
much as looking toward him, and this gave him a
sense of loneliness such as had come into his heart
when he found himself amid strangers, the only survivor
of the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i>.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact there was not a member of
the crew but that would have enjoyed taking the
lad in his arms and declaring that he should never
leave the station, no matter how many uncles might
send for him; but every man understood the question
was too important to be decided hastily, and
also that it would be cruel, perhaps, to speak such
words as might influence the boy.</p>

<p>Benny waited a moment or more, hoping Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Hardy might give him some consolation; but as the
surfman remained silent with averted face, the sore-hearted
lad, gathering Fluff in his arms, went out
upon the wind-swept rocks to struggle as best he
might with the great grief which had so suddenly
come upon him.</p>

<p>Seating himself within view of the reef upon
which the <i class="ship">Amazonia</i> had gone to pieces, and covering
Fluff with his coat as best he might, the lad
gave himself up to reflection&mdash;not as to what was
best for him to do regarding the matter of going to
his uncle; but concerning the cruel tricks which
fortune seemed to be playing him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know neither mother nor Mrs. Clark would
want us to go off to that old man who never cared
for us a cent&rsquo;s worth till he saw the news of the
shipwreck in the papers, and it&rsquo;s horrible for him
to interfere just when we&rsquo;d got into such a nice
place!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog licked his master&rsquo;s face, and interpreting
this as meaning Fluff fully agreed with him, Benny
continued mournfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go, Fluffy, and that&rsquo;s all there is to
it. If the crew say we can&rsquo;t stay here because that
man claims the right to order us &rsquo;round, we&rsquo;ll run
off somewhere by our own two selves, an&rsquo; see if it
won&rsquo;t be possible to make another home. But
we&rsquo;ll never find such a pleasant place as this, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
matter how much good luck we have! It seemed
as if the men liked us, an&rsquo; after there&rsquo;d been time
to grow, we&rsquo;d come out as regular surfmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog whined because he was cold, but Benny
fully believed it to be in reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re sorry, Fluff! Anybody&rsquo;d
be; an&rsquo; what <i>is</i> to become of us? You&rsquo;ve got a
collar and a medal, and there&rsquo;s my two suits of
clothes; but we&rsquo;ll need some place to sleep in the
very first night of leaving here, and where&rsquo;ll we
find it? The money the passengers gave us is in
the bank, and I suppose Andrew Foster will think
it belongs to him, so we can&rsquo;t count on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fluff twisted and squirmed until he escaped from
his master&rsquo;s arms, for the embrace was much too
close to please him, and as he capered and danced,
begging to be taken back to the station Benny&rsquo;s
grief increased:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you want to stay here, Fluffy; but how
can I fix things? It&rsquo;s going to be terrible hard on
you to go where folks won&rsquo;t want you in the house
&rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re a dog, an&rsquo; we can&rsquo;t be together
much of the time. Oh, what shall we do, you poor
little man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Believing himself hidden from view of the life
savers, the lad gave way to the grief in his heart,
and, lying face downward upon the rocks, he allowed
the tears to flow unchecked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
It was Sam Hardy who, missing Benny from the
station, had come out fearing to find him in much
such a frame of mind.</p>

<p>During two or three minutes the kindly-hearted
surfman stood over him in silence, while Fluff remained
near by wagging his tail as if asking what
had gone wrong so suddenly, and then, bending
over, Sam Hardy lifted the sorrowing boy in his
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look you, lad, it&rsquo;s wrong to get all down to
the heel in this fashion when a question comes up
which is to be settled as nearly for your good as we
can figger it out. A life-savin&rsquo; station ain&rsquo;t the
kind of a home which is needed by a boy of your
age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only kind I want!&rdquo; Benny sobbed.
&ldquo;Fluffy an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll never find another so good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you believe now, No. 8; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me No. 8? If I&rsquo;m to be sent
away from here it shows I never was one of the
crew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have been, an&rsquo; always will be, Benny,
lad. Even if you go away we shall never speak or
think of you except as &lsquo;No. 8,&rsquo; the gritty little
mate who brought something like sunshine into the
dull station, and kept the gleam there every minute
he stayed with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, Mr. Hardy, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
talk like that! When you say you&rsquo;re sorry, and
yet keep on talking as if it was settled that I&rsquo;d got
to go, it breaks me all up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little chicken, it strikes me you&rsquo;re badly
broken up already!&rdquo; And Sam stroked the boy&rsquo;s
hair with his huge, rough hand, while Fluff crept
under the life saver&rsquo;s arm as if asking that he be
given due share of the caresses. &ldquo;If we of the
crew did only that which pleased us best, you&rsquo;d
never have a show for leavin&rsquo;; but, as Tom Downey
says, we&rsquo;re bound to think only of what may be for
your good, an&rsquo; in making up our minds it is with
the hope we&rsquo;ll go right for your sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man, Andrew Foster, don&rsquo;t care about
Fluffy an&rsquo; me, &rsquo;cause he never so much as saw
us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That same thought has been in my mind,
Benny, lad, an&rsquo; Joe Cushing has been makin&rsquo;
similar talk. If we were certain he&rsquo;d care for you
as we do, the matter would be settled, for it stands
to reason you should have a different home than
this. But I don&rsquo;t like the way his letter reads, nor
do the rest of the boys; so you see, lad, the question
ain&rsquo;t settled by a long chalk yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please try to make the men want to keep me!
Please try, Mr. Hardy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart, No. 8, there&rsquo;s no need of my
tryin&rsquo; to do anything of the kind. The only trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
is we&rsquo;re so eager for you to stay that we&rsquo;re afraid
of ourselves&mdash;afraid we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be actin&rsquo; square by
you. Here&rsquo;s Tom Downey been sayin&rsquo; that he&rsquo;d
be willin&rsquo; to give up ten dollars a month out of his
pay for so long a time as he is in the service, for the
sake of havin&rsquo; you &rsquo;round, an&rsquo; Dick Sawyer is
threatenin&rsquo; all sorts of terrible things against your
uncle because he wrote the letter. We want you,
lad, as badly as you want to be with us, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; it so hard to settle the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny twined his arms around the surfman&rsquo;s
neck, and the latter, lifting him as tenderly as he
would an infant, carried him back to the station,
Fluff following close at his heels, barking with delight
because they had finally decided to go in out
of the cold wind.</p>

<p>Now it was that Benny&rsquo;s grief became more intense;
this time because of the unusual tenderness
and attention shown by every member of the crew.
Each man appeared as if striving to show the boy
some particular attention as proof of the esteem in
which he was held, and try as he might, No. 8
could not hold back the tears of mingled pleasure
and sorrow.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day each member of
the crew went around softly, hardly speaking above
a whisper, as one does when in the presence of some
great affliction, and the cook positively forbade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Benny&rsquo;s going into the kitchen for the purpose of
assisting in the work.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 192px;"><img id="ip_304" src="images/i314.jpg" width="192" height="252" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if I was going right off in the morning,&rdquo;
No. 8 said confidently to Sam Hardy, his
voice breaking now and then because of the sobs.
&ldquo;But suppose it is decided that I must leave, will I
have to start right off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless you, lad, there&rsquo;d be no call for
anything like that. Writing to your uncle an&rsquo;
getting an answer back will take a week at the best,
and then we shall try to&mdash;Well, there, No. 8,
what&rsquo;s the sense of our talkin&rsquo; about your goin&rsquo;
away? When it comes right down to the fact, I
ain&rsquo;t sure as I could say that you&rsquo;d best go to this
Andrew Foster, even though I might know it was
for your good. Let&rsquo;s put
master Fluff through his
lessons, and see if we can&rsquo;t
work something like cheerfulness
into this crew, for
it&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; to be as solemn
a time as I ever took part
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fluff was ready and even
eager to do what he might
to dispel the gloom, although
it is not to be supposed that he had such
an idea in his white head when he obeyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
surfman&rsquo;s command to &ldquo;sit up and smoke his
pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the evening the men, and with them
Benny, grew more cheerful. Now and then one
would speak of what No. 8 must do as soon as the
warm weather came, as if the matter was already
settled that the lad should remain.</p>

<p>The cook exerted himself to prepare a most appetizing
supper, and it was served half an hour
earlier than usual so that all hands, save the lookout
on the hill, might be present. The men told
stories and made jokes during the meal as if the
sole object was to prevent their own and No. 8&rsquo;s
thoughts from roaming into the future.</p>

<p>Yet after all these efforts it was impossible to impart
a thorough air of gayety to the scene, and it
was with something like a sense of relief that the
crew heard the hoof-beats of a horse over the stone
road, telling that a visitor was near at hand.</p>

<p>Dick Sawyer opened the door to welcome this opportune
arrival, and as he peered out into the twilight
an exclamation of glad surprise burst from his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Bradford! Most likely he&rsquo;s
come to see how the new uniform fits, an&rsquo; accordin&rsquo;
to my way of thinkin&rsquo;, he couldn&rsquo;t have appeared
in a better time, for now we&rsquo;ll be able to get a bit
of advice on a difficult question from one who is
interested in the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman whose coming was thus announced
must have been surprised by the warmth with which
he was received. The members of the crew greeted
him as an old friend, and each appeared eager to
engage him in conversation.</p>

<p>Benny, holding Fluff in his arms, stood in the
background, waiting until his comrades had come to
an end of their words of welcome, and, catching a
glimpse of him, Mr. Bradford made his way toward
that portion of the room, in total disregard of the
fact that Dick Sawyer was doing his best to explain
how an unusually large bag of ducks might be
taken in a certain cove not far from the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my boy, you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; as solemn as an
owl, and even young Mr. Fluff isn&rsquo;t as cheerful
as when I saw him last! What&rsquo;s the matter?
Didn&rsquo;t the uniform fit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, and it&rsquo;s beautiful&mdash;beautiful; and
I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able to wear it because I&rsquo;ve got to go
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a particularly big sob came into Benny&rsquo;s
throat, and he found it impossible to speak
further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away?&rdquo; Mr. Bradford repeated in surprise,
and turning to the others he asked, &ldquo;What does
the lad mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was proper Tom Downey should act as spokesman,
and, recognizing this fact, he began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
necessary explanations by handing the visitor the
letter which had caused so much sorrow at the
station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take off your overcoat, and make yourself
comfortable here by the table while you read this;
then you&rsquo;ll know what Benny means. But he goes
a little too far when he says he&rsquo;s <i>got</i> to leave, for
we haven&rsquo;t settled the question yet, and since
you&rsquo;re here, if the rest of the crew are willing, I go
in for leavin&rsquo; it to you. We want him to stay;
yet are afraid of doin&rsquo; what mightn&rsquo;t be to his best
interests, therefore it puts us in a bad fix, so far as
makin&rsquo; up our minds is concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bradford looked thoroughly mystified, as he
had good cause for being, but he did as the speaker
had suggested, in the way of making himself comfortable,
and then read the letter from Mr. Andrew
Foster, studying it so long that Benny began to
fear perhaps he did not wish to venture an opinion
on the subject.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the life savers seated themselves
around him, each man looking inquiringly, eagerly,
at the one whom they had thus suddenly decided
should be the judge.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Bradford looked up from the paper
toward Benny and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you hear from your uncle&mdash;before
this, I mean?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew there was such a man, and wish
he&rsquo;d kept his letters to himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was your mother sick long before she died?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only two weeks, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t she mention the name of Andrew
Foster&mdash;never speak of your Uncle Andrew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, sir; I am sure she never said
very much about him, and I can&rsquo;t remember ever
having heard his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a very affectionate letter, eh, Downey?&rdquo;
and Mr. Bradford held out the missive as if thinking
the keeper might like to see it again before replying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it struck all hands of us, and is
one thing which has caused us to think perhaps it
would be as well for Benny to stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to keep him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Bradford; we would like to have him
and Fluff stay, if it so be the lad wouldn&rsquo;t be injurin&rsquo;
his prospects in life. We&rsquo;ve come to look
upon him as belongin&rsquo; to us in a sort of way. Perhaps
you can&rsquo;t understand it; but we who live here
alone, tied down to the station day and night, get
kind of peculiar, I reckon. You see, we&rsquo;re mostly
by ourselves all winter, and run into whims an&rsquo;
fancies more than other men. The sea brought the
boy to us, so to speak, and, even though he&rsquo;s where
he can hear it, I must say a better lad never lived&mdash;leastways,
so far as my experience goes. Here&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
the whole hitch: we can&rsquo;t hope to make more than
a surfman out of him, and it may be the good Lord
has fitted him for something better, though he
couldn&rsquo;t follow a more honest callin&rsquo;. Now if this
uncle of his would send him to college, and start
him out into the world as many a boy is started,
we&rsquo;d put aside our own feelin&rsquo;s, knowin&rsquo; No. 8 was
to be benefited; but if he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; &rsquo;way up there
in the middle of York State to do the drudgery
of a farm, or some such kind of work, why, then,
unless it&rsquo;s contrary to law, we&rsquo;d hold him here in
spite of his uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you answered this letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. You see, it didn&rsquo;t get here till a few
hours ago, an&rsquo; we had agreed not to make up our
minds before to-morrow mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a good idea to find
out who Mr. Andrew Foster is, and whether he&rsquo;s
likely to give the boy a good home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would, for a fact, sir; but how might that be
done? We are not allowed to leave the station for
a longer time than twenty-four hours, and then
only one of the crew can have a furlough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many easier methods of learning all
the public may know concerning a man than to send
a messenger in search of the knowledge. Suppose
you authorize me to make the necessary inquiries&mdash;it
won&rsquo;t cost you anything,&mdash;and in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
perhaps a week I shall be able to tell you as much
regarding Benny&rsquo;s uncle as his neighbors can. I
suppose, as a matter of fact, that by applying to
the courts he may have himself appointed guardian
for the lad and take him away; but I question
whether an uncle who wasn&rsquo;t spoken of in terms of
affection by the boy&rsquo;s father and mother would take
such trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talkin&rsquo;, we ain&rsquo;t fit to settle any
kind of a discussion,&rdquo; Sam Hardy exclaimed emphatically.
&ldquo;Here we&rsquo;ve been moonin&rsquo; &rsquo;round
tryin&rsquo; to make up our minds whether Benny should
go or not, an&rsquo; never once thinkin&rsquo; of what would
have come into another man&rsquo;s mind at the jump.
Of course we want to know who Andrew Foster is,
and what he&rsquo;s likely to do for Benny? Then it&rsquo;s
only a question of sayin&rsquo; who will give the boy the
best start in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll look after this matter for us, Mr.
Bradford?&rdquo; Tom Downey asked, an expression of
relief coming over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will, and be glad of the opportunity
of doing a favor for No. 8. Cheer up, my lad,&rdquo; he
added turning toward Benny who, as the conversation
progressed, had been gradually drawing nearer
the friendly visitor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a long ways from
leaving this crew yet, and I&rsquo;ll be surprised if the
matter comes out differently from what you wish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
With all hands of us to consider which may be the
best move, there shouldn&rsquo;t remain any chance for
mistake. Choke back those sobs; go up and put
your uniform on, and let me see how you and Fluff
C. Foster look on parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was really astonishing what a change Mr. Bradford
had wrought by a few commonplace words.</p>

<p>The expression of gloom disappeared from all the
faces, and the men whose time for going on patrol
had arrived set about making ready for the duty
with the greatest alacrity.</p>

<p>Benny ran up-stairs, eager to do as this kindly
friend suggested, and in an instant, as it were,
something very like joy reigned where lately all had
been mourning.</p>

<p>No. 8 displayed himself in all his finery; Fluff
performed his tricks in the most approved fashion;
the keeper and the surfmen told stories which were
not all concerning wrecks and loss of life; the cook
made a lobster salad as his portion of the merrymaking,
and the evening which had bade fair to be
such a gloomy one, was, as all declared, the most
enjoyable that had been spent in the station for
many a month.</p>

<p>Then, promising to report by telephone whenever
he should have gained any information, the visitor
took his departure, and it was time for Sam Hardy
and No. 8 to do their share of patrol work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
&ldquo;Come, lad,&rdquo; the surfman said cheerily. &ldquo;I
had counted on your stayin&rsquo; under cover to-night;
but seein&rsquo; &rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re likely to hold on here, for
I believe Mr. Bradford will fix things accordin&rsquo; to
our likin&rsquo;, you may just as well continue to toughen
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the two went out into the night, and it
would be difficult to say which carried the lighter
heart in his bosom.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE DECISION.</span></h2>

<p>Although Mr. Bradford&rsquo;s advice and willingness
to take charge of Benny&rsquo;s business had given great
relief of mind to all concerned, the fears of the crew
concerning the future were by no means dispelled.</p>

<p>When the gentleman had stated so positively that
several weeks must necessarily elapse before the
question could properly be settled, even Benny felt
as if a great load of care had suddenly been removed;
but on the following morning, after the
men had had time to view the matter from every
point, there appeared much in it which was not
pleasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like this,&rdquo; Sam Hardy said to Joe
Cushing when the two met behind the engine-house
for a private conversation on the morning following
Mr. Bradford&rsquo;s visit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like this: If Andrew
Foster turns out to be some crusty old curmudgeon
who&rsquo;s bound to have his own way, he&rsquo;ll
insist on Benny&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to him the very minute he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
finds out we want to keep the lad, therefore it stands
us in hand to keep mighty quiet as to our wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, supposin&rsquo; he does claim the lad?&rdquo; Joe
Cushing replied hotly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought this thing
over a good bit since Mr. Bradford left, an&rsquo; have
made up my mind that, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned,
No. 8 is at liberty to stay with us if he says the
word. What&rsquo;s the reason he won&rsquo;t make as much
of a man while stoppin&rsquo; here as if he was in York
State? I go in for tellin&rsquo; Andrew Foster that
we haven&rsquo;t got the time to run around huntin&rsquo; up
his relations; but we count on keepin&rsquo; the boy who
was given to us by the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of the crew wouldn&rsquo;t agree to anything
quite so strong as that,&rdquo; Hardy suggested
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason they wouldn&rsquo;t? Dick
Sawyer, Henry Robbins, and Henderson said not
half an hour ago that they&rsquo;d back me in holdin&rsquo; on
to the lad, never mind how many uncles flashed
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Downey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to keep Benny with us, an&rsquo; would
come out strong except that he&rsquo;s afraid it will work
the boy some harm in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that why you wanted me to come out
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I counted that you&rsquo;d agree with us, an&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
we might settle the question without waitin&rsquo; for
what Mr. Bradford may pick up in the way of
information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;ll be wiser to wait, Joe. There&rsquo;s
plenty of time to take a bold stand after we know
whether Andrew Foster really wants the boy, or if
he&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; so simply because he thinks folks will
make queer talk if he don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe Cushing was by no means satisfied to follow
this advice; but he could not persuade Sam Hardy
to do as he had proposed, and the interview came
to an end.</p>

<p>During the week which ensued the members of
the crew talked often, one with another but not in a
body, regarding what should be done in case Benny&rsquo;s
uncle demanded that the boy come to him, and the
general opinion appeared to be that the decision
ought by right to be left to No. 8 himself.</p>

<p>As a matter of course no one suggested such an
idea to Benny. He was given to understand that
everything depended upon the information procured
by Mr. Bradford, and a most anxious time it
was to him.</p>

<p>More than once he referred to the matter when
alone with Sam Hardy, but the surfman refused to
discuss it, and only to Fluff could he pour out all
that was in his heart. That he would run away
rather than go to this uncle, who had written concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
him as if he was no more than a bale of
merchandise, he told Fluff again and again, and in
order to be prepared for such a move, Benny questioned
the cook concerning the surrounding country,
until the latter believed it his duty to inform the
keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lad is makin&rsquo; ready to give us the slip if it
turns out that the crew believe he should leave,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;captain of the kitchen&rdquo; said to Tom Downey.
&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve seen of him there&rsquo;s no doubt in
my mind but that he&rsquo;ll do it rather than go to this
uncle of whom he never heard before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because of the fear that Benny might be tempted
to do something desperate in case the information
Mr. Bradford received was of such a nature as warranted
a careful consideration of Andrew Foster&rsquo;s
claim, it was decided that the lad be kept in ignorance
regarding what the gentleman might succeed
in learning until the crew could weigh the matter
well in joint discussion.</p>

<p>It so chanced, however, that Benny himself was
the first to hear from Mr. Bradford, and the crew
were thwarted in their good intentions by that piece
of mechanism known as the telephone.</p>

<p>The boy was alone in the station on the fifth day
after Andrew Foster&rsquo;s letter was received, and,
hearing the bell ring, answered the call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he cried, replying as he had often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
heard Mr. Downey, and then, placing the receiver
to his ear, he awaited the message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the Life-Saving Station?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s at the &rsquo;phone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;Benny Foster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Benny, how is young Foster? It is
Bradford who is speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fluffy is very well, thank you. All the crew,
and even the cook, are outside, sir. Shall I call
any one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it will be as well if I speak with you
first, and then we&rsquo;ll have a word with the keeper.
Heard anything from your uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, and I hope I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. Say, Mr. Bradford,
would you go to him if you were in my place
and had such a good home as this, where Fluffy can
do almost whatever he wants to? You know some
folks think a dog ain&rsquo;t nice to come into the house,
and I don&rsquo;t know what the poor little man would
do if he was sent into the shed or a barn to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re having it very comfortable out there,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we are, Mr. Bradford. Maje has got
through bothering Fluff, and the men are as kind to
me as if we was own folks. I&rsquo;d feel awful bad to
go away; but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll have to do if Andrew
Foster says I must live with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t thinking of running off are you, Benny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what Fluff and I have made up our
minds to do, sir, though I wouldn&rsquo;t like for you to
tell Mr. Downey. We&rsquo;ll never go off with folks we
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your uncle might give you a much better home
than you have now, Benny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t do it, sir. No one would ever be
as good to me as are the members of this crew, and,
what&rsquo;s better than all the rest, I can earn my own
way here&mdash;everybody says I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve quite made up your mind not to
leave the station?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir; I&rsquo;ll have to leave if the men decide
that I must, but neither Fluff nor I will go to
Andrew Foster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where do you count on going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we don&rsquo;t know, sir. I was coming
in first to ask you where we might find a place to
work for enough to pay our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to hear what your uncle has to
say regarding the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t make any difference to us, sir; we
won&rsquo;t go to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I mean is, would you like to hear the letter
read which I have just received from him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he say I&rsquo;ve got to go where he lives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen while I read, bearing in mind that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
wrote the day after leaving the station, explaining
how you were situated, and asking if he believed it
was best to take you from those who were willing
to assume all charge. The letter has just been received,
and you shall hear it: &lsquo;I am in receipt of
your favor of the 4th, and it pleases me to learn
that my nephew, for I have no doubt as to his being
my brother&rsquo;s son, has found such good friends. I
am not really in a position to give a young boy that
care which he should have, and would never have
written asking that he be sent on, but that I deemed
it my duty. I am an old man, living alone with
servants, and of such a disposition that even my
only brother could not agree with me. If the boy
is comfortable and happy, and I can be assured the
life savers will give him proper care, he shall receive
from me the sum of two hundred dollars each year
in quarterly payments, dependent only upon his
writing me a truthful account of his situation at
least once every twelve months, but not oftener.
In case you are willing to burden yourself with the
transaction of the business, I shall be glad to leave
everything in your hands, agreeing to do in the
premises whatever you may believe to be right,
providing I am not called upon for more than I
have stated herein.&rsquo; That is the letter, Benny,
exactly as he wrote it, and I have read every word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No. 8 stood with the receiver pressed tightly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
his ear, a look of perplexity on his face, and after a
long pause asked hesitatingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say anything more, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see but that he has covered the subject
fully, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But does he still think I must go where he
lives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny could hear Mr. Bradford laughing, and he
wondered why the gentleman should have thought
there was anything comical in a question so important
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are any of the crew within call?&rdquo; Mr. Bradford
asked at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Hardy is in the oil-room, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him I am at the &rsquo;phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam was coming toward the station when Benny
opened the door, and on being told who desired to
speak with him, he hurried forward, an expression
of anxiety appearing on his face.</p>

<p>There was a decided change in his countenance
five minutes later, and then he dropped the receiver
very suddenly to grasp Benny&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, No. 8! The whole matter is
settled in great shape, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m beginnin&rsquo; to think
Andrew Foster is a decent sort of an old fogy after
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to stay here?&rdquo; Benny cried, trembling
violently because of the prolonged suspense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what you are to do, my boy,
and your uncle will pay two hundred dollars a year
towards puttin&rsquo; you through school in proper
shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to pay us anything so long as
we can stay here,&rdquo; Benny replied quickly, tears of
joy and relief welling up in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s right he should do it, No. 8, an&rsquo; it
shows that he&rsquo;s got a decent heart, even though it
may be moss-grown. Now you are one of us, an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;ll be strange if seven able-bodied men can&rsquo;t provide
one little lad with food, lodgin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; schoolin&rsquo;,
particularly since he earns a good deal more&rsquo;n he
costs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sam ran to the door, shouting for the members
of the crew at the full strength of his lungs,
and in a few moments all were gathered, waiting to
learn the reason for the sudden summons.</p>

<p>It was a difficult matter for the surfman to tell
the story intelligibly; but after a time he succeeded
in making his comrades understand that there was
no longer any cause to fear that No. 8 might be
taken from them, and then ensued such a merrymaking
as, perhaps, no life-saving station has ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>The men congratulated each other, then Benny,
and, finally, Fluff, who had been sitting up begging
for information&mdash;or sugar; and when this had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
done, went through the same ceremony again and
again, until Tom Downey declared that such &ldquo;crazy
antics must come to an end,&rdquo; lest some visitor
should suddenly appear and think the crew had
gone mad.</p>

<p>Nor were they wholly quieted down when Mr.
Bradford arrived early in the evening, and then the
reading of Andrew Foster&rsquo;s letter aroused them to
yet more noisy hilarity.</p>

<p>Amid all the confusion Benny was strangely quiet.
He held Fluff pressed tightly in his arms, and gazed
first at one and then the other in such a serious
fashion that Mr. Bradford finally asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Benny? You don&rsquo;t seem to be as
happy as I had expected?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy, Mr. Bradford! Fluffy and I are so
happy that we don&rsquo;t dare to make much noise for
fear we&rsquo;ll wake up and find it&rsquo;s all been a dream.
No dog and boy in this world ever had it so nice as
Fluffy an&rsquo; I, and it makes us almost frightened for
fear we shan&rsquo;t do enough to keep the crew glad all
the time &rsquo;cause we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not afraid that you won&rsquo;t do enough,
No. 8,&rdquo; Tom Downey said gravely. &ldquo;The greatest
trouble is that you may try to do too much. We
are the ones who should fear lest we fail in giving
you all the chances other boys enjoy. We count
on seein&rsquo; that you have a good education, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
if it so happens that you believe the life-saving service
is good enough for you, we&rsquo;ll be satisfied; but
we&rsquo;re countin&rsquo; on your makin&rsquo; such a mark in the
world as will puff us all up with pride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benny made no attempt to reply; he did not dare
trust his voice, and at such a time tears would have
shamed him; but he put Fluff on the floor, ordering
him to &ldquo;stand up,&rdquo; and the two remained erect for
several seconds, silently giving thanks for the great
kindness and loving tenderness displayed toward
these homeless ones.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It would be a pleasing task to depict Benny as he
advances through life, winning the praise and admiration
of those around him for the sterling qualities
displayed; but as yet he has not made very
much progress in carving for himself a name.</p>

<p>He is now at school, and Fluff remains at the
station, happy all the time, but particularly so from
Friday night until Monday morning, when his
young master &ldquo;comes home&rdquo; to the station.</p>

<p>No. 8&rsquo;s teachers report that he is a studious, well-behaved
boy, and both Sam Hardy and Joe Cushing
declare whenever the subject is brought up, that if
he so desires, Benny shall &ldquo;get all the schoolin&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s to be had for money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, he received the medal of honor for life-saving,
when his successful work on the night the crew were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
taken from the stranded steamer had been properly
represented at headquarters, and every Sunday he
and Fluff wear their decorations, much to the satisfaction
of their guardians, the men of the Life-Saving
Service.</p>

<h3 class="p1">GENERAL RULES OBSERVED IN STOWING THE
ABOVE GEAR.</h3>

<p>1. Every rope made securely fast to a thwart by
one end, the other end being kept clear for immediate
use.</p>

<p>2. Each rope coiled, as much as possible, under a
seat.</p>

<p>3. Each rope coiled in a loose coil, so as to allow
the air to have access to all parts of it.</p>

<h3>REGULATIONS.</h3>

<p>1. The keepers of life-boat stations will be held
responsible to the Government for the proper care
and order, cleanliness, and efficiency of the life-boat,
and everything pertaining to her.</p>

<p>2. The keeper of each life-boat station will frequently
open the doors and windows of the boat-house;
keep the pump-well hatch and ventilating-hatches
of the boat open when the boat is not in
use; and often examine such of her gear as would
suffer injury from dampness, and dry it by exposure
to the sun or wind. He will exercise proper precautions
against the warping of the oars by their
remaining long in one position, and see that they
are not left supported only at the ends.</p>

<p>3. The keeper will keep all the boat&rsquo;s gear as far
as possible in the boat, except the lantern (which
has first to be trimmed and is only wanted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
night service) and the life-belts, so that no delay
may take place in handing gear into the boat when
going on service, and no risk be run of leaving anything
behind.</p>

<p>4. The ropes and other gear of the life-boat must
on no account be used for private purposes, nor,
where avoidable, for any other purpose than that
for which they are provided.</p>

<p>5. Whenever any small articles are injured or
destroyed, they should be instantly repaired or
replaced, and the Superintendent of the district
informed accordingly; and when any ropes or other
articles of importance are worn-out or destroyed,
the fact should be made known at once to the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>6. Whenever the life-belts have been wet through
with salt water, they should be dipped and washed
in fresh water if practicable, and perfectly dried as
soon as possible, their durability, without repair,
much depending upon this being done.</p>

<p>7. Where there is a carriage to the boat, the
wheels should be taken off at least twice a year and
the axle-arms greased and the roller-skids should
be kept in good order by oiling their axle-bolts
occasionally.</p>

<p>8. The life-boat will be manned by the keeper, a bowman,
and as many boatmen as the boat pulls oars, and
the keeper will have charge of the boat as coxswain.</p>
